This program is a Map Editor based on the videogame Super Mario.

Program Properties:

On startup, the program loads pre-made arrangement of Goombas, Tubes, and Mario.

Using the left & right arrow keys moves Mario accordingly. The Mario movement animation is created using multiple png files looping whenever movement is detected.

Spacebar makes mario jump. Mario can jump higher by holding spacebar. Mario can jump only once, he can jump again once he lands on a surface.

Sprite Collision Detection is in place so that Mario does not phase through Tubes from any direction. This allows Mario to stand on Tubes and Goombas to bounce between tubes.

Goombas are now generated and are allows on the move. If they run into a Tube, they change direction.

Pressing 'ctrl' makes Mario throw a fireball. Any fireball that makes contact with a Goomba causes the Goomba to burn then disappear.
