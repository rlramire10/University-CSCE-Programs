A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom
through all the land  Nothing was hidden from him and it seemed
as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through
the air  But he had a strange custom every day after dinner
when the table was cleared and no one else was present a trusty
servant had to bring him one more dish  It was covered however
and even the servant did not know what was in it neither did
anyone know for the king never took off the cover to eat of it
until he was quite alone
This had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who
took away the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he
could not help carrying the dish into his room  When he had
carefully locked the door he lifted up the cover and saw a white
snake lying on the dish  But when he saw it he could not deny
himself the pleasure of tasting it so he cut off a little bit
and put it into his mouth  No sooner had it touched his tongue
than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his
window  He went and listened and then noticed that it was
the sparrows who were chattering together and telling one
another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields
and woods  Eating the snake had given him power of understanding
the language of animals
Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most
beautiful ring and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this
trusty servant who was allowed to go everywhere  The king
ordered the man to be brought before him and threatened with
angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out
the thief he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed
In vain he declared his innocence he was dismissed with no better
answer
In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took
thought how to help himself out of his trouble  Now
some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking
their rest and whilst they were making their feathers smooth
with their bills they were having a confidential conversation
together  The servant stood by and listened  They were telling
one another of all the places where they had been waddling
about all the morning and what good food they had found and one
said in a pitiful tone something lies heavy on my stomach as I
was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the
queens window  The servant at once seized her by the neck
carried her to the kitchen and said to the cook here is a fine
duck pray kill her  Yes said the cook and weighed her in
his hand she has spared no trouble to fatten herself and has
been waiting to be roasted long enough  So he cut off her head
and as she was being dressed for the spit the queens ring was
found inside her
The servant could now easily prove his innocence and the king
to make amends for the wrong allowed him to ask a favor and
promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for
The servant refused everything and only asked for a horse and
some money for traveling as he had a mind to see the world
and go about a little  When his request was granted he
set out on his way and one day came to a pond where he saw
three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water  Now
though it is said that fishes are dumb he heard them lamenting
that they must perish so miserably and as he had a kind heart
he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the
water  They leapt with delight put out their heads and cried
to him we will remember you and repay you for saving us
