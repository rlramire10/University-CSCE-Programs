The standard WordCount.java program utilizes a mapper class and a reducer class to read,
identify, count, and combine words as a wordpair. Additionally, it saves the input as 
Text objects. This allows the program to sort all the wordpairs though the built-in 
compare method. This means that the wordpairs can be sorted in reverse alphabetical
order if you modifiy the compare method. 

For this new program, we created a modified text file that an alternate compare method. 
Tipically, the compare method looks at two objects and returns either a -1, 0, or 1 based 
on if the first object is less than, equal, or greater than the second object. Since the
placement of each word is dependant on a binary system, reverse alphabetical order can be
achieved if the return value is multiplied by -1. This would result in returning the
opposite sign which would naturally flip the sorted order.
