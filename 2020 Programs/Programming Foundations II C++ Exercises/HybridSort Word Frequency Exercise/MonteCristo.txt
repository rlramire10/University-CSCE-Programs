 Chapter 1. Marseillesâ€”The Arrival

On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde
signalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and
Naples.

As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If,
got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean
were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a
ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,
has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs
to an owner of the city.

The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
PomÃ¨gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,
but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is
the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have
happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly
that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,
for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the
anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by
the side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the
narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity
and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each
direction of the pilot.

The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the
vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled
alongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La
RÃ©serve basin.

When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his
station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the shipâ€™s
bulwarks.

He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with
black eyes, and hair as dark as a ravenâ€™s wing; and his whole
appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men
accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.

â€œAh, is it you, DantÃ¨s?â€ cried the man in the skiff. â€œWhatâ€™s the
matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?â€

â€œA great misfortune, M. Morrel,â€ replied the young man, â€œa great
misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
Captain Leclere.â€

â€œAnd the cargo?â€ inquired the owner, eagerly.

â€œIs all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that
head. But poor Captain Leclereâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat happened to him?â€ asked the owner, with an air of considerable
resignation. â€œWhat happened to the worthy captain?â€

â€œHe died.â€

â€œFell into the sea?â€

â€œNo, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.â€ Then turning to
the crew, he said, â€œBear a hand there, to take in sail!â€

All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to
the owner.

â€œAnd how did this misfortune occur?â€ inquired the latter, resuming the
interrupted conversation.

0023m



â€œAlas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the
harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his
rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head
and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword
and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,â€ added the young man
with a melancholy smile, â€œto make war against the English for ten
years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.â€

â€œWhy, you see, Edmond,â€ replied the owner, who appeared more comforted
at every moment, â€œwe are all mortal, and the old must make way for the
young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure
me that the cargoâ€”â€”â€

â€œIs all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise
you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.â€

Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
â€œStand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!â€

The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a
man-of-war.

â€œLet goâ€”and clue up!â€ At this last command all the sails were lowered,
and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.

â€œNow, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,â€ said DantÃ¨s, observing the
ownerâ€™s impatience, â€œhere is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out
of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I
must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.â€

The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
DantÃ¨s flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit
to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man,
going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came
towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of
age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors,
insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as
responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors,
made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond DantÃ¨s was beloved by
them.

â€œWell, M. Morrel,â€ said Danglars, â€œyou have heard of the misfortune
that has befallen us?â€

â€œYesâ€”yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.â€

â€œAnd a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,
as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as
that of Morrel & Son,â€ replied Danglars.

â€œBut,â€ replied the owner, glancing after DantÃ¨s, who was watching the
anchoring of his vessel, â€œit seems to me that a sailor needs not be so
old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend
Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require
instruction from anyone.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.
â€œYes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was
the captainâ€™s breath out of his body when he assumed the command
without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at
the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.â€

0025m



â€œAs to taking command of the vessel,â€ replied Morrel, â€œthat was his
duty as captainâ€™s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of
Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.â€

â€œThe vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,
M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.â€

â€œDantÃ¨s,â€ said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, â€œcome this
way!â€

â€œIn a moment, sir,â€ answered DantÃ¨s, â€œand Iâ€™m with you.â€ Then calling
to the crew, he said, â€œLet go!â€

The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through
the port-hole. DantÃ¨s continued at his post in spite of the presence of
the pilot, until this manÅ“uvre was completed, and then he added,
â€œHalf-mast the colors, and square the yards!â€

â€œYou see,â€ said Danglars, â€œhe fancies himself captain already, upon my
word.â€

â€œAnd so, in fact, he is,â€ said the owner.

â€œExcept your signature and your partnerâ€™s, M. Morrel.â€

â€œAnd why should he not have this?â€ asked the owner; â€œhe is young, it is
true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.â€

A cloud passed over Danglarsâ€™ brow.

â€œYour pardon, M. Morrel,â€ said DantÃ¨s, approaching, â€œthe vessel now
rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?â€

Danglars retreated a step or two. â€œI wished to inquire why you stopped
at the Island of Elba?â€

â€œI do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain
Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.â€

â€œThen did you see him, Edmond?â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œThe marshal.â€

â€œYes.â€

Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing DantÃ¨s on one side, he said
suddenlyâ€”

â€œAnd how is the emperor?â€

â€œVery well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.â€

â€œYou saw the emperor, then?â€

â€œHe entered the marshalâ€™s apartment while I was there.â€

â€œAnd you spoke to him?â€

â€œWhy, it was he who spoke to me, sir,â€ said DantÃ¨s, with a smile.

â€œAnd what did he say to you?â€

â€œAsked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the
course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &
Son. â€˜Ah, yes,â€™ he said, â€˜I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners
from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same
regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.â€™â€

â€œ_Pardieu!_ and that is true!â€ cried the owner, greatly delighted. â€œAnd
that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.
DantÃ¨s, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you
will see it will bring tears into the old soldierâ€™s eyes. Come, come,â€
continued he, patting Edmondâ€™s shoulder kindly, â€œyou did very right,
DantÃ¨s, to follow Captain Leclereâ€™s instructions, and touch at Elba,
although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the
marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into
trouble.â€

0027m



â€œHow could that bring me into trouble, sir?â€ asked DantÃ¨s; â€œfor I did
not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made
such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are
the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.â€ And
the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached,
and said,â€”

â€œWell, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his
landing at Porto-Ferrajo?â€

â€œYes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.â€

â€œWell, so much the better,â€ said the supercargo; â€œfor it is not
pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.â€

â€œDantÃ¨s has done his,â€ replied the owner, â€œand that is not saying much.
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.â€

â€œTalking of Captain Leclere, has not DantÃ¨s given you a letter from
him?â€

â€œTo me?â€”noâ€”was there one?â€

â€œI believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter
to his care.â€

â€œOf what packet are you speaking, Danglars?â€

â€œWhy, that which DantÃ¨s left at Porto-Ferrajo.â€

â€œHow do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?â€

Danglars turned very red.

â€œI was passing close to the door of the captainâ€™s cabin, which was half
open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to DantÃ¨s.â€

â€œHe did not speak to me of it,â€ replied the shipowner; â€œbut if there be
any letter he will give it to me.â€

Danglars reflected for a moment. â€œThen, M. Morrel, I beg of you,â€ said
he, â€œnot to say a word to DantÃ¨s on the subject. I may have been
mistaken.â€

At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.

â€œWell, my dear DantÃ¨s, are you now free?â€ inquired the owner.

â€œYes, sir.â€

â€œYou have not been long detained.â€

â€œNo. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and
as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I
gave them.â€

â€œThen you have nothing more to do here?â€

â€œNoâ€”everything is all right now.â€

â€œThen you can come and dine with me?â€

â€œI really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due
to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have
done me.â€

0029m



â€œRight, DantÃ¨s, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.â€

â€œAnd,â€ inquired DantÃ¨s, with some hesitation, â€œdo you know how my
father is?â€

â€œWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.â€

â€œYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.â€

â€œThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your
absence.â€

DantÃ¨s smiled. â€œMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,
I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from
Heaven.â€

â€œWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on
you.â€

â€œI must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has
been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.â€

â€œTrue, DantÃ¨s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who
expects you no less impatiently than your fatherâ€”the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

DantÃ¨s blushed.

â€œAh, ha,â€ said the shipowner, â€œI am not in the least surprised, for she
has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the
_Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!â€

â€œShe is not my mistress,â€ replied the young sailor, gravely; â€œshe is my
betrothed.â€

â€œSometimes one and the same thing,â€ said Morrel, with a smile.

â€œNot with us, sir,â€ replied DantÃ¨s.

â€œWell, well, my dear Edmond,â€ continued the owner, â€œdonâ€™t let me detain
you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all
the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?â€

â€œNo, sir; I have all my pay to takeâ€”nearly three monthsâ€™ wages.â€

â€œYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.â€

â€œSay I have a poor father, sir.â€

â€œYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see
your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those
who detained him from me after a three monthsâ€™ voyage.â€

â€œThen I have your leave, sir?â€

â€œYes, if you have nothing more to say to me.â€

â€œNothing.â€

â€œCaptain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?â€

â€œHe was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your
leave of absence for some days.â€

â€œTo get married?â€

â€œYes, first, and then to go to Paris.â€

â€œVery good; have what time you require, DantÃ¨s. It will take quite six
weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until
three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the
_Pharaon_,â€ added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back,
â€œcannot sail without her captain.â€

â€œWithout her captain!â€ cried DantÃ¨s, his eyes sparkling with animation;
â€œpray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes
of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the
_Pharaon_?â€

â€œIf I were sole owner weâ€™d shake hands on it now, my dear DantÃ¨s, and
call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian
proverbâ€”_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_â€”â€˜He who has a partner has a
master.â€™ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of
two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.â€

â€œAh, M. Morrel,â€ exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes,
and grasping the ownerâ€™s hand, â€œM. Morrel, I thank you in the name of
my father and of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œThatâ€™s all right, Edmond. Thereâ€™s a providence that watches over the
deserving. Go to your father; go and see MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and afterwards come
to me.â€

â€œShall I row you ashore?â€

â€œNo, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with
Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?â€

â€œThat is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you
mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the
day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose
to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle
the disputeâ€”a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite
right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the
question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you
will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.â€

â€œBut tell me, DantÃ¨s, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be
glad to see Danglars remain?â€

â€œCaptain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect
for those who possess the ownersâ€™ confidence.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right, thatâ€™s right, DantÃ¨s! I see you are a thoroughly good
fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you
are.â€

â€œThen I have leave?â€

â€œGo, I tell you.â€

â€œMay I have the use of your skiff?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œThen, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!â€

â€œI hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.â€

The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern
sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La CanebiÃ¨re. The two
oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly
as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the
narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of
the harbor to the Quai dâ€™OrlÃ©ans.

The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him
spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which
from five oâ€™clock in the morning until nine oâ€™clock at night, swarms in
the famous street of La CanebiÃ¨re,â€”a street of which the modern
PhocÃ©ens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,
and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, â€œIf
Paris had La CanebiÃ¨re, Paris would be a second Marseilles.â€ On turning
round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders,
but in reality also watching the young sailor,â€”but there was a great
difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
movements of Edmond DantÃ¨s.



 Chapter 2. Father and Son

We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and
endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil
suspicions against his comrade, and follow DantÃ¨s, who, after having
traversed La CanebiÃ¨re, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small
house, on the left of the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four
flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while
with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused
before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small
room.

This room was occupied by DantÃ¨sâ€™ father. The news of the arrival of
the _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair,
was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and
sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.
Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice
behind him exclaimed, â€œFatherâ€”dear father!â€

The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he
fell into his arms, pale and trembling.

â€œWhat ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?â€ inquired the young
man, much alarmed.

â€œNo, no, my dear Edmondâ€”my boyâ€”my son!â€”no; but I did not expect you;
and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyâ€”Ah, I feel as if I were
going to die.â€

â€œCome, come, cheer up, my dear father! â€™Tis Iâ€”really I! They say joy
never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do
smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and
we are going to be happy.â€

â€œYes, yes, my boy, so we willâ€”so we will,â€ replied the old man; â€œbut
how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me
all the good fortune that has befallen you.â€

â€œGod forgive me,â€ said the young man, â€œfor rejoicing at happiness
derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek
this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to
lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable
that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you
understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred
louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor
sailor like me could have hoped for?â€

â€œYes, my dear boy,â€ replied the old man, â€œit is very fortunate.â€

â€œWell, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small
house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and
honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?â€

â€œâ€™Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass awayâ€â€”and as he said so the
old manâ€™s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the young man, â€œa glass of wine, father, will revive
you. Where do you keep your wine?â€

â€œNo, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,â€ said the
old man.

â€œYes, yes, father, tell me where it is,â€ and he opened two or three
cupboards.

â€œIt is no use,â€ said the old man, â€œthere is no wine.â€

â€œWhat, no wine?â€ said DantÃ¨s, turning pale, and looking alternately at
the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. â€œWhat, no
wine? Have you wanted money, father?â€

â€œI want nothing now that I have you,â€ said the old man.

â€œYet,â€ stammered DantÃ¨s, wiping the perspiration from his brow,â€”â€œyet I
gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.â€

â€œYes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little
debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I
did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,
lest he might do you an injuryâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWhy, I paid him.â€

â€œBut,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œit was a hundred and forty francs I owed
Caderousse.â€

â€œYes,â€ stammered the old man.

â€œAnd you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?â€

The old man nodded.

â€œSo that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,â€ muttered
Edmond.

â€œYou know how little I require,â€ said the old man.

â€œHeaven pardon me,â€ cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his
father.

â€œWhat are you doing?â€

â€œYou have wounded me to the heart.â€

â€œNever mind it, for I see you once more,â€ said the old man; â€œand now
itâ€™s all overâ€”everything is all right again.â€

0035m



â€œYes, here I am,â€ said the young man, â€œwith a promising future and a
little money. Here, father, here!â€ he said, â€œtake thisâ€”take it, and
send for something immediately.â€ And he emptied his pockets on the
table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six
five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old DantÃ¨s
brightened.

â€œWhom does this belong to?â€ he inquired.

â€œTo me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and
tomorrow we shall have more.â€

â€œGently, gently,â€ said the old man, with a smile; â€œand by your leave I
will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy
too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your
return, in order to be able to purchase them.â€

â€œDo as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I
will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and
most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall
have tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.â€

â€œâ€™Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to
congratulate you on your fortunate return.â€

â€œAh, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,â€ murmured
Edmond. â€œBut, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on
a time, so heâ€™s welcome.â€

As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at
the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of
cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.

â€œWhat, is it you, Edmond, back again?â€ said he, with a broad
Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.

â€œYes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you
in any and every way,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, but ill-concealing his coldness
under this cloak of civility.

â€œThanksâ€”thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it
chances that at times there are others who have need of me.â€ DantÃ¨s
made a gesture. â€œI do not allude to you, my boy. No!â€”no! I lent you
money, and you returned it; thatâ€™s like good neighbors, and we are
quits.â€

â€œWe are never quits with those who oblige us,â€ was DantÃ¨sâ€™ reply; â€œfor
when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk
of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece
of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. â€˜You at
Marseilles?â€™â€”â€˜Yes,â€™ says he.

â€œâ€˜I thought you were at Smyrna.â€™â€”â€˜I was; but am now back again.â€™

â€œâ€˜And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?â€™

â€œâ€˜Why, with his father, no doubt,â€™ replied Danglars. And so I came,â€
added Caderousse, â€œas fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking
hands with a friend.â€

0037m



â€œWorthy Caderousse!â€ said the old man, â€œhe is so much attached to us.â€

â€œYes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are
so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,â€ continued the
tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which DantÃ¨s
had thrown on the table.

The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes
of his neighbor. â€œEh,â€ he said, negligently, â€œthis money is not mine. I
was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in
my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,
fatherâ€ added DantÃ¨s, â€œput this money back in your boxâ€”unless neighbor
Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.â€

â€œNo, my boy, no,â€ said Caderousse. â€œI am not in any want, thank God, my
living is suited to my means. Keep your moneyâ€”keep it, I say;â€”one never
has too much;â€”but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by
your offer as if I took advantage of it.â€

â€œIt was offered with good will,â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œNo doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I
hear,â€”you insinuating dog, you!â€

â€œM. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,â€ replied DantÃ¨s.

â€œThen you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.â€

â€œWhat, did you refuse to dine with him?â€ said old DantÃ¨s; â€œand did he
invite you to dine?â€

â€œYes, my dear father,â€ replied Edmond, smiling at his fatherâ€™s
astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.

â€œAnd why did you refuse, my son?â€ inquired the old man.

â€œThat I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,â€ replied the
young man. â€œI was most anxious to see you.â€

â€œBut it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,â€ said Caderousse.
â€œAnd when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy
the owner.â€

â€œBut I explained to him the cause of my refusal,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œand
I hope he fully understood it.â€

â€œYes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to oneâ€™s
patrons.â€

â€œI hope to be captain without that,â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œSo much the betterâ€”so much the better! Nothing will give greater
pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the
Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€ said the old man.

â€œYes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,
and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent
to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.â€

â€œGo, my dear boy,â€ said old DantÃ¨s; â€œand Heaven bless you in your wife,
as it has blessed me in my son!â€

â€œHis wife!â€ said Caderousse; â€œwhy, how fast you go on, father DantÃ¨s;
she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.â€

â€œNo, but according to all probability she soon will be,â€ replied
Edmond.

â€œYesâ€”yes,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut you were right to return as soon as
possible, my boy.â€

â€œAnd why?â€

â€œBecause MercÃ©dÃ¨s is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack
followers; she particularly has them by dozens.â€

â€œReally?â€ answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of
slight uneasiness.

0039m



â€œAh, yes,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œand capital offers, too; but you
know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?â€

â€œMeaning to say,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, with a smile which but ill-concealed
his trouble, â€œthat if I were not a captainâ€”â€”â€

â€œEhâ€”eh!â€ said Caderousse, shaking his head.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the sailor, â€œI have a better opinion than you of
women in general, and of MercÃ©dÃ¨s in particular; and I am certain that,
captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.â€

â€œSo much the betterâ€”so much the better,â€ said Caderousse. â€œWhen one is
going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but
never mind that, my boy,â€”go and announce your arrival, and let her know
all your hopes and prospects.â€

â€œI will go directly,â€ was Edmondâ€™s reply; and, embracing his father,
and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.

Caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old DantÃ¨s, he
went downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of
the Rue Senac.

â€œWell,â€ said Danglars, â€œdid you see him?â€

â€œI have just left him,â€ answered Caderousse.

â€œDid he allude to his hope of being captain?â€

â€œHe spoke of it as a thing already decided.â€

â€œIndeed!â€ said Danglars, â€œhe is in too much hurry, it appears to me.â€

â€œWhy, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.â€

â€œSo that he is quite elated about it?â€

â€œWhy, yes, he is actually insolent over the matterâ€”has already offered
me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a
loan of money, as though he were a banker.â€

â€œWhich you refused?â€

â€œMost assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I
who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.
DantÃ¨s has no longer any occasion for assistanceâ€”he is about to become
a captain.â€

â€œPooh!â€ said Danglars, â€œhe is not one yet.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,â€ answered Caderousse; â€œfor
if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.â€

â€œIf we choose,â€ replied Danglars, â€œhe will remain what he is; and
perhaps become even less than he is.â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

â€œNothingâ€”I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the
Catalane?â€

â€œOver head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a
storm in that quarter.â€

0041m



â€œExplain yourself.â€

â€œWhy should I?â€

â€œIt is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like DantÃ¨s?â€

â€œI never like upstarts.â€

â€œThen tell me all you know about the Catalane.â€

â€œI know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to
believe, as I told you, that the future captain will find some
annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.â€

â€œWhat have you seen?â€”come, tell me!â€

â€œWell, every time I have seen MercÃ©dÃ¨s come into the city she has been
accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red
complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.â€

â€œReally; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?â€

â€œI only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean
with a fine wench of seventeen?â€

â€œAnd you say that DantÃ¨s has gone to the Catalans?â€

â€œHe went before I came down.â€

â€œLet us go the same way; we will stop at La RÃ©serve, and we can drink a
glass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.â€

â€œCome along,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut you pay the score.â€

â€œOf course,â€ replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated
place, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.

PÃ¨re Pamphile had seen DantÃ¨s pass not ten minutes before; and assured
that he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of
the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were
singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring.



 Chapter 3. The Catalans

Beyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot
where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their
wine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony
quitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this
day. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of
its chiefs, who understood ProvenÃ§al, begged the commune of Marseilles
to give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors
of old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and
three months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels
which had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up.
This village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half
Moorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants
of the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three
or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on
which they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with
the Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their
original customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have
preserved its language.

Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little
village, and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the
beautiful dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and
within coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and
beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the
gazelleâ€™s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in
her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the
flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her
arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the
Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she
tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the
pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and
blue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair
which he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten
table, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was
looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were
mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze
of the young girl controlled his look.

â€œYou see, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ said the young man, â€œhere is Easter come round
again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?â€

â€œI have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be
very stupid to ask me again.â€

â€œWell, repeat it,â€”repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe
it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had
your motherâ€™s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are
trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.
Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and
to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!â€

â€œAt least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,â€
replied MercÃ©dÃ¨s; â€œyou cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.
I have always said to you, â€˜I love you as a brother; but do not ask
from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is anotherâ€™s.â€™ Is
not this true, Fernand?â€

â€œYes, that is very true, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ replied the young man, â€œYes, you
have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the
Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?â€

0045m



â€œYou mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I
pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in
the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,
liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,
what would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,
with nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable
inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She
has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost
entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,
and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and
I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my fatherâ€™s brother,
because we were brought up together, and still more because it would
give you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this
fish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax
I spin,â€”I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.â€

â€œAnd if it were, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as
well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of
Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful
housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?â€

â€œFernand,â€ answered MercÃ©dÃ¨s, shaking her head, â€œa woman becomes a bad
manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she
loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my
friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will
promise no more than I can bestow.â€

â€œI understand,â€ replied Fernand, â€œyou can endure your own wretchedness
patiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, beloved by
you, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should
become rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a
place as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.â€

â€œYou could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you
remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a
fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you
more.â€

â€œWell, I will do better, MercÃ©dÃ¨s. I will be a sailor; instead of the
costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,
a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.
Would not that dress please you?â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ asked MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with an angry glance,â€”â€œwhat do you
mean? I do not understand you?â€

â€œI mean, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because
you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you
await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.â€

â€œFernand,â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€œI believed you were good-hearted, and I was
mistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the
anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of
whom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of
the inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died
loving me and me only.â€ The young girl made a gesture of rage. â€œI
understand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not
love you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end
would that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and
see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me,
to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who
loves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil
thoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself
with having me for your friend and sister; and besides,â€ she added, her
eyes troubled and moistened with tears, â€œwait, wait, Fernand; you said
just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four
months, and during these four months there have been some terrible
storms.â€

Fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which
flowed down the cheeks of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, although for each of these tears he
would have shed his heartâ€™s blood; but these tears flowed for another.
He arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly
stopping before MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with his eyes glowing and his hands
clenched,â€”â€œSay, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ he said, â€œonce for all, is this your final
determination?â€

â€œI love Edmond DantÃ¨s,â€ the young girl calmly replied, â€œand none but
Edmond shall ever be my husband.â€

â€œAnd you will always love him?â€

â€œAs long as I live.â€

Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was
like a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with
clenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,â€”â€œBut if he is deadâ€”â€”â€

â€œIf he is dead, I shall die too.â€

â€œIf he has forgotten youâ€”â€”â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€ called a joyous voice from without,â€”â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€

â€œAh,â€ exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly
leaping in excess of love, â€œyou see he has not forgotten me, for here
he is!â€ And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, â€œHere,
Edmond, here I am!â€

Fernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight
of a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s
were clasped in each otherâ€™s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which
shot into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of
light. At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness
isolated them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in
broken words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem
rather the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale,
and threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the
shadow. By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself,
the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.

â€œAh, your pardon,â€ said DantÃ¨s, frowning in his turn; â€œI did not
perceive that there were three of us.â€ Then, turning to MercÃ©dÃ¨s, he
inquired, â€œWho is this gentleman?â€

â€œOne who will be your best friend, DantÃ¨s, for he is my friend, my
cousin, my brother; it is Fernandâ€”the man whom, after you, Edmond, I
love the best in the world. Do you not remember him?â€

â€œYes!â€ said DantÃ¨s, and without relinquishing MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™ hand clasped in
one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial
air. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,
remained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly
at the agitated and embarrassed MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and then again on the gloomy
and menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.

â€œI did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet
an enemy here.â€

â€œAn enemy!â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, with an angry look at her cousin. â€œAn enemy
in my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my
arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to
return to it no more.â€

Fernandâ€™s eye darted lightning. â€œAnd should any misfortune occur to
you, dear Edmond,â€ she continued with the same calmness which proved to
Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his
sinister thought, â€œif misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend
the highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from
it.â€

Fernand became deadly pale. â€œBut you are deceived, Edmond,â€ she
continued. â€œYou have no enemy hereâ€”there is no one but Fernand, my
brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.â€

And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the
Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and
offered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,
was broken against the strong ascendancy which MercÃ©dÃ¨s exercised over
him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmondâ€™s hand when he felt he
had done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.

â€œOh,â€ he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hairâ€”â€œOh, who
will deliver me from this man? Wretchedâ€”wretched that I am!â€

â€œHallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?â€ exclaimed a
voice.

The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.

â€œWellâ€, said Caderousse, â€œwhy donâ€™t you come? Are you really in such a
hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?â€

â€œParticularly when they have still a full bottle before them,â€ added
Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not
say a word.

â€œHe seems besotted,â€ said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.
â€œAre we mistaken, and is DantÃ¨s triumphant in spite of all we have
believed?â€

â€œWhy, we must inquire into that,â€ was Caderousseâ€™s reply; and turning
towards the young man, said, â€œWell, Catalan, canâ€™t you make up your
mind?â€

Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness
to his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his
exhausted body.

â€œGood-day,â€ said he. â€œYou called me, didnâ€™t you?â€ And he fell, rather
than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.

â€œI called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid
you would throw yourself into the sea,â€ said Caderousse, laughing.
â€œWhy, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of
wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of
water unnecessarily!â€

Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into
his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.

â€œWell, Fernand, I must say,â€ said Caderousse, beginning the
conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which
curiosity destroys all diplomacy, â€œyou look uncommonly like a rejected
lover;â€ and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

â€œBah!â€ said Danglars, â€œa lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in
love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.â€

â€œNo,â€ he replied, â€œonly hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,â€ said
Caderousse, â€œhold up your head, and answer us. Itâ€™s not polite not to
reply to friends who ask news of your health.â€

â€œMy health is well enough,â€ said Fernand, clenching his hands without
raising his head.

â€œAh, you see, Danglars,â€ said Caderousse, winking at his friend, â€œthis
is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,
one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very
fine girl, named MercÃ©dÃ¨s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine
girl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_
arrived todayâ€”why, you understand!â€

â€œNo; I do not understand,â€ said Danglars.

â€œPoor Fernand has been dismissed,â€ continued Caderousse.

â€œWell, and what then?â€ said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking
at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his
anger; â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not
free to love whomsoever she will?â€

â€œOh, if you take it in that sense,â€ said Caderousse, â€œit is another
thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans
were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was
even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.â€

Fernand smiled piteously. â€œA lover is never terrible,â€ he said.

â€œPoor fellow!â€ remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from
the bottom of his heart. â€œWhy, you see, he did not expect to see DantÃ¨s
return so suddenlyâ€”he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance
faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come
suddenly.â€

â€œAh, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!â€ said Caderousse, who drank as
he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take
effect,â€”â€œunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out
by the fortunate arrival of DantÃ¨s; is he, Danglars?â€

â€œNo, you are rightâ€”and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.â€

â€œWell, never mind,â€ answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine
for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while
Danglars had merely sipped his. â€œNever mindâ€”in the meantime he marries
MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”at least he returns to do that.â€

During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man,
on whose heart Caderousseâ€™s words fell like molten lead.

â€œAnd when is the wedding to be?â€ he asked.

â€œOh, it is not yet fixed!â€ murmured Fernand.

â€œNo, but it will be,â€ said Caderousse, â€œas surely as DantÃ¨s will be
captain of the _Pharaon_â€”eh, Danglars?â€

Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,
whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow
was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.

â€œWell,â€ said he, filling the glasses, â€œlet us drink to Captain Edmond
DantÃ¨s, husband of the beautiful Catalane!â€

Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and
swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.

â€œEh, eh, eh!â€ stammered Caderousse. â€œWhat do I see down there by the
wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are
better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver;
but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in
hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and
they are actually embracing!â€

Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.

â€œDo you know them, Fernand?â€ he said.

â€œYes,â€ was the reply, in a low voice. â€œIt is Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€

â€œAh, see there, now!â€ said Caderousse; â€œand I did not recognize them!
Hallo, DantÃ¨s! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know
when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not
tell us.â€

â€œHold your tongue, will you?â€ said Danglars, pretending to restrain
Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the
arbor. â€œTry to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without
interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is
well-behaved!â€

0051m



Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the
bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen
from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong
upon his rival, when MercÃ©dÃ¨s, smiling and graceful, lifted up her
lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this
Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped
again heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after
the other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with
love.

â€œI shall get nothing from these fools,â€ he muttered; â€œand I am very
much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Hereâ€™s an
envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing
his wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from
under his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes
that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and
Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one
blow. Unquestionably, Edmondâ€™s star is in the ascendant, and he will
marry the splendid girlâ€”he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all,
unlessâ€â€”a sinister smile passed over Danglarsâ€™ lipsâ€”â€œunless I take a
hand in the affair,â€ he added.

â€œHallo!â€ continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the
table, â€œhallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too
proud to speak to them?â€

â€œNo, my dear fellow!â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œI am not proud, but I am happy,
and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.â€

â€œAh, very well, thatâ€™s an explanation!â€ said Caderousse. â€œHow do you
do, Madame DantÃ¨s?â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s courtesied gravely, and saidâ€”â€œThat is not my name, and in my
country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the
name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me
MercÃ©dÃ¨s, if you please.â€

â€œWe must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œhe is
so easily mistaken.â€

â€œSo, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. DantÃ¨s,â€ said
Danglars, bowing to the young couple.

â€œAs soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be
arranged at my fatherâ€™s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
wedding festival here at La RÃ©serve. My friends will be there, I hope;
that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.â€

â€œAnd Fernand,â€ said Caderousse with a chuckle; â€œFernand, too, is
invited!â€

â€œMy wifeâ€™s brother is my brother,â€ said Edmond; â€œand we, MercÃ©dÃ¨s and
I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.â€

Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and
he could not utter a word.

â€œToday the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in
a hurry, captain!â€

â€œDanglars,â€ said Edmond, smiling, â€œI will say to you as MercÃ©dÃ¨s said
just now to Caderousse, â€˜Do not give me a title which does not belong
to meâ€™; that may bring me bad luck.â€

â€œYour pardon,â€ replied Danglars, â€œI merely said you seemed in a hurry,
and we have lots of time; the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in
less than three months.â€

â€œWe are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have
suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I
must go to Paris.â€

â€œAh, really?â€”to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been
there, DantÃ¨s?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHave you business there?â€

â€œNot of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know
to what I allude, Danglarsâ€”it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the
time to go and return.â€

â€œYes, yes, I understand,â€ said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he
added, â€œTo Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand
marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an ideaâ€”a capital idea! Ah;
DantÃ¨s, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the
good ship _Pharaon_;â€ then turning towards Edmond, who was walking
away, â€œA pleasant journey,â€ he cried.

â€œThank you,â€ said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers
continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
elect of heaven.



 Chapter 4. Conspiracy

Danglars followed Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s with his eyes until the two
lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas;
then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and
trembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of
a drinking-song.

â€œWell, my dear sir,â€ said Danglars to Fernand, â€œhere is a marriage
which does not appear to make everybody happy.â€

â€œIt drives me to despair,â€ said Fernand.

â€œDo you, then, love MercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€

â€œI adore her!â€

â€œFor long?â€

â€œAs long as I have known herâ€”always.â€

â€œAnd you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy
your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.â€

â€œWhat would you have me do?â€ said Fernand.

â€œHow do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle
MercÃ©dÃ¨s; but for youâ€”in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall
find.â€

â€œI have found already.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œI would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune
happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.â€

â€œPooh! Women say those things, but never do them.â€

â€œYou do not know MercÃ©dÃ¨s; what she threatens she will do.â€

â€œIdiot!â€ muttered Danglars; â€œwhether she kill herself or not, what
matter, provided DantÃ¨s is not captain?â€

â€œBefore MercÃ©dÃ¨s should die,â€ replied Fernand, with the accents of
unshaken resolution, â€œI would die myself!â€

â€œThatâ€™s what I call love!â€ said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than
ever. â€œThatâ€™s love, or I donâ€™t know what love is.â€

â€œCome,â€ said Danglars, â€œyou appear to me a good sort of fellow, and
hang me, I should like to help you, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes,â€ said Caderousse, â€œbut how?â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ replied Danglars, â€œyou are three parts drunk; finish
the bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not
meddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all oneâ€™s wit and
cool judgment.â€

â€œIâ€”drunk!â€ said Caderousse; â€œwell thatâ€™s a good one! I could drink four
more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. PÃ¨re
Pamphile, more wine!â€

And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.

â€œYou were saying, sirâ€”â€”â€ said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the
end of this interrupted remark.

â€œWhat was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose
the thread of my sentence.â€

â€œDrunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it
is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will
extract from their hearts;â€ and Caderousse began to sing the two last
lines of a song very popular at the time:

â€˜Tous les mÃ©chants sont buveurs dâ€™eau;

Câ€™est bien prouvÃ© par le dÃ©luge.â€™1


â€œYou said, sir, you would like to help me, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that DantÃ¨s did
not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,
methinks, and yet DantÃ¨s need not die.â€

â€œDeath alone can separate them,â€ remarked Fernand.

â€œYou talk like a noodle, my friend,â€ said Caderousse; â€œand here is
Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to
you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you.
Say there is no need why DantÃ¨s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity
he should. DantÃ¨s is a good fellow; I like DantÃ¨s. DantÃ¨s, your
health.â€

Fernand rose impatiently. â€œLet him run on,â€ said Danglars, restraining
the young man; â€œdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.
Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were
between Edmond and MercÃ©dÃ¨s they would be as effectually separated as
if he lay under a tombstone.â€

0056m



â€œYes; but one gets out of prison,â€ said Caderousse, who, with what
sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, â€œand when one
gets out and oneâ€™s name is Edmond DantÃ¨s, one seeks revengeâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat matters that?â€ muttered Fernand.

â€œAnd why, I should like to know,â€ persisted Caderousse, â€œshould they
put DantÃ¨s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.â€

â€œHold your tongue!â€ said Danglars.

â€œI wonâ€™t hold my tongue!â€ replied Caderousse; â€œI say I want to know why
they should put DantÃ¨s in prison; I like DantÃ¨s; DantÃ¨s, your health!â€
and he swallowed another glass of wine.

0057m



Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his
intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, â€œWell, you understand
there is no need to kill him.â€

â€œCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having
DantÃ¨s arrested. Have you that means?â€

â€œIt is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the
matter? it is no affair of mine.â€

â€œI know not why you meddle,â€ said Fernand, seizing his arm; â€œbut this I
know, you have some motive of personal hatred against DantÃ¨s, for he
who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.â€

â€œI! motives of hatred against DantÃ¨s? None, on my word! I saw you were
unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; thatâ€™s all; but since you
believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the
affair as best you may;â€ and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.

â€œNo, no,â€ said Fernand, restraining him, â€œstay! It is of very little
consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry
feeling or not against DantÃ¨s. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you
find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,
for MercÃ©dÃ¨s has declared she will kill herself if DantÃ¨s is killed.â€

Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and
looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, â€œKill DantÃ¨s!
who talks of killing DantÃ¨s? I wonâ€™t have him killedâ€”I wonâ€™t! Heâ€™s my
friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I
shared mine with him. I wonâ€™t have DantÃ¨s killedâ€”I wonâ€™t!â€

â€œAnd who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?â€ replied
Danglars. â€œWe were merely joking; drink to his health,â€ he added,
filling Caderousseâ€™s glass, â€œand do not interfere with us.â€

â€œYes, yes, DantÃ¨sâ€™ good health!â€ said Caderousse, emptying his glass,
â€œhereâ€™s to his health! his healthâ€”hurrah!â€

â€œBut the meansâ€”the means?â€ said Fernand.

â€œHave you not hit upon any?â€ asked Danglars.

â€œNo!â€”you undertook to do so.â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied Danglars; â€œthe French have the superiority over the
Spaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the French invent.â€

â€œDo you invent, then,â€ said Fernand impatiently.

â€œWaiter,â€ said Danglars, â€œpen, ink, and paper.â€

â€œPen, ink, and paper,â€ muttered Fernand.

â€œYes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without
my tools I am fit for nothing.â€

â€œPen, ink, and paper, then,â€ called Fernand loudly.

â€œThereâ€™s what you want on that table,â€ said the waiter.

â€œBring them here.â€ The waiter did as he was desired.

0059m



â€œWhen one thinks,â€ said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,
â€œthere is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at
the corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had more dread
of a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or
pistol.â€

â€œThe fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,â€ said Danglars. â€œGive
him some more wine, Fernand.â€ Fernand filled Caderousseâ€™s glass, who,
like the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and
seized the glass.

The Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh
assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the
table.

â€œWell!â€ resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of
Caderousseâ€™s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.

â€œWell, then, I should say, for instance,â€ resumed Danglars, â€œthat if
after a voyage such as DantÃ¨s has just made, in which he touched at the
Island of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the kingâ€™s procureur as
a Bonapartist agentâ€”â€”â€

â€œI will denounce him!â€ exclaimed the young man hastily.

â€œYes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront
you with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of
supporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But DantÃ¨s cannot
remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and
the day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his
incarceration!â€

â€œOh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a
quarrel with me.â€

â€œYes, and MercÃ©dÃ¨s! MercÃ©dÃ¨s, who will detest you if you have only the
misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!â€

â€œTrue!â€ said Fernand.

â€œNo, no,â€ continued Danglars; â€œif we resolve on such a step, it would
be much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink,
and write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized)
the denunciation we propose.â€ And Danglars, uniting practice with
theory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his
usual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he
handed to Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:

â€œThe honorable, the kingâ€™s attorney, is informed by a friend of the
throne and religion, that one Edmond DantÃ¨s, mate of the ship
_Pharaon_, arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at
Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for
the usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist
committee in Paris. Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him,
for the letter will be found upon him, or at his fatherâ€™s, or in his
cabin on board the _Pharaon_.â€

â€œVery good,â€ resumed Danglars; â€œnow your revenge looks like common
sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will
thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter
as I am doing, and write upon it, â€˜To the kingâ€™s attorney,â€™ and thatâ€™s
all settled.â€ And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.

â€œYes, and thatâ€™s all settled!â€ exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last
effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and
instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation
must entail. â€œYes, and thatâ€™s all settled; only it will be an infamous
shame;â€ and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.

â€œYes,â€ said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; â€œand as what I
say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost,
should be sorry if anything happened to DantÃ¨sâ€”the worthy DantÃ¨sâ€”look
here!â€ And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw
it into a corner of the arbor.

â€œAll right!â€ said Caderousse. â€œDantÃ¨s is my friend, and I wonâ€™t have
him ill-used.â€

â€œAnd who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,â€
said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained
seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper
flung into the corner.

â€œIn this case,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œletâ€™s have some more wine. I wish
to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œYou have had too much already, drunkard,â€ said Danglars; â€œand if you
continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand
on your legs.â€

â€œI?â€ said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken
man, â€œI canâ€™t keep on my legs? Why, Iâ€™ll wager I can go up into the
belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!â€

â€œDone!â€ said Danglars, â€œIâ€™ll take your bet; but tomorrowâ€”today it is
time to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.â€

â€œVery well, let us go,â€ said Caderousse; â€œbut I donâ€™t want your arm at
all. Come, Fernand, wonâ€™t you return to Marseilles with us?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Fernand; â€œI shall return to the Catalans.â€

â€œYouâ€™re wrong. Come with us to Marseillesâ€”come along.â€

â€œI will not.â€

â€œWhat do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;
thereâ€™s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the
young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.â€

Danglars took advantage of Caderousseâ€™s temper at the moment, to take
him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he
went.

When they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw
Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his
pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.

â€œWell,â€ said Caderousse, â€œwhy, what a lie he told! He said he was going
to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are
coming, my boy!â€

â€œOh, you donâ€™t see straight,â€ said Danglars; â€œheâ€™s gone right by the
road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Caderousse, â€œI should have sworn that he turned to the
rightâ€”how treacherous wine is!â€

â€œCome, come,â€ said Danglars to himself, â€œnow the thing is at work and
it will effect its purpose unassisted.â€



 Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast

The morningâ€™s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves
into a network of ruby-tinted light.

The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La RÃ©serve, with
whose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for
the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each
of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the
name of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a
wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although
the entertainment was fixed for twelve oâ€™clock, an hour previous to
that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,
consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _Pharaon_, and other
personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to
the occasion.

Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the
_Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed
unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding
condescension could possibly be intended.

Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by
Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had
recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his
intention to dine at La RÃ©serve.

In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an
enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _Pharaon_, who
hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man
whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first
in command of the ship; and as DantÃ¨s was universally beloved on board
his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at
finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly
coincided with their own.

With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched
in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the
arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a
lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.

Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but
ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards
them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in
attendance on the bride, by whose side walked DantÃ¨sâ€™ father; the whole
brought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.

Neither MercÃ©dÃ¨s nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his
countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
sunshine and the presence of each other.

Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty
shake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their
places beside Fernand and old DantÃ¨s,â€”the latter of whom attracted
universal notice.

The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed
with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but wiry
legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,
evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat
depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came
along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged
countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one
of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the
Luxembourg and Tuileries.

Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good
things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become
reconciled to the DantÃ¨s, father and son, although there still lingered
in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the
preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the
dim and misty outline of a dream.

0065m



As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,
who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten
that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted;
occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance,
and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated
and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like
one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.

DantÃ¨s himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar
to the merchant serviceâ€”a costume somewhat between a military and a
civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and
happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be
imagined.

Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, MercÃ©dÃ¨s boasted the same
bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved
with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more
practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes
beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed
lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes;
but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile
that seemed to say: â€œIf you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am
very happy.â€

As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La RÃ©serve, M. Morrel
descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and
sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already
given, that DantÃ¨s should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere.
Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of
his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting
her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the
feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose
heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of
several minutes.

â€œFather,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, stopping when she had reached the centre of
the table, â€œsit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place
him who has ever been as a brother to me,â€ pointing with a soft and
gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the
direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even
beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen
retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.

During this time, DantÃ¨s, at the opposite side of the table, had been
occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was
seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from
Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most
agreeable.

Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages,
and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and
brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel
within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than
rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the
delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the
sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen â€œfruits of the sea.â€

â€œA pretty silence truly!â€ said the old father of the bridegroom, as he
carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the
topaz, and which had just been placed before MercÃ©dÃ¨s herself. â€œNow,
would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who
desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?â€

â€œAh,â€ sighed Caderousse, â€œa man cannot always feel happy because he is
about to be married.â€

â€œThe truth is,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œthat I am too happy for noisy mirth;
if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you
are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us
almost the same as sorrow.â€

Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and
betrayed each fresh impression.

â€œWhy, what ails you?â€ asked he of Edmond. â€œDo you fear any approaching
evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this
instant.â€

â€œAnd that is the very thing that alarms me,â€ returned DantÃ¨s. â€œMan does
not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness
is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where
fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of
all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I
own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of
which I feel myself unworthyâ€”that of being the husband of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œNay, nay!â€ cried Caderousse, smiling, â€œyou have not attained that
honor yet. MercÃ©dÃ¨s is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and
manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is
not yet come!â€

The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start
at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops
of perspiration that gathered on his brow.

â€œWell, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
contradict me for such a trifle as that. â€™Tis true that MercÃ©dÃ¨s is not
actually my wife; but,â€ added he, drawing out his watch, â€œin an hour
and a half she will be.â€

A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the
exception of the elder DantÃ¨s, whose laugh displayed the still perfect
beauty of his large white teeth. MercÃ©dÃ¨s looked pleased and gratified,
while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.

â€œIn an hour?â€ inquired Danglars, turning pale. â€œHow is that, my
friend?â€

â€œWhy, thus it is,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. â€œThanks to the influence of M.
Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every
difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the
usual delay; and at half-past two oâ€™clock the Mayor of Marseilles will
be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has
already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying,
that, in another hour and thirty minutes MercÃ©dÃ¨s will have become
Madame DantÃ¨s.â€

0069m



Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow,
and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his
falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not
refrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the
noisy felicitations of the company.

â€œUpon my word,â€ cried the old man, â€œyou make short work of this kind of
affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three
oâ€™clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!â€

â€œBut,â€ asked Danglars, in a timid tone, â€œhow did you manage about the
other formalitiesâ€”the contractâ€”the settlement?â€

â€œThe contract,â€ answered DantÃ¨s, laughingly, â€œit didnâ€™t take long to
fix that. MercÃ©dÃ¨s has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So,
you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come
very expensive.â€ This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.

â€œSo that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to
be the actual wedding dinner!â€ said Danglars.

â€œNo, no,â€ answered DantÃ¨s; â€œdonâ€™t imagine I am going to put you off in
that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to
go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission
entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back
here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage
feast.â€

This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests
to such a degree, that the elder DantÃ¨s, who, at the commencement of
the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it
difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a momentâ€™s
tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the
bride and bridegroom.

DantÃ¨s, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded
by a look of grateful pleasure; while MercÃ©dÃ¨s glanced at the clock and
made an expressive gesture to Edmond.

Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at
such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social
position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the
commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves
according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out
more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting
for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or
her own thoughts.

Fernandâ€™s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As
for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and,
as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such
deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther
end of the salon.

Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most
anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.

â€œUpon my word,â€ said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment
of DantÃ¨s, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken
of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at DantÃ¨sâ€™ good
fortune,â€”â€œupon my word, DantÃ¨s is a downright good fellow, and when I
see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I
cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him
that trick you were planning yesterday.â€

â€œOh, there was no harm meant,â€ answered Danglars; â€œat first I certainly
did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but
when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as
to become one of his rivalâ€™s attendants, I knew there was no further
cause for apprehension.â€ Caderousse looked full at Fernandâ€”he was
ghastly pale.

â€œCertainly,â€ continued Danglars, â€œthe sacrifice was no trifling one,
when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future
captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take
his place.â€

â€œShall we not set forth?â€ asked the sweet, silvery voice of MercÃ©dÃ¨s;
â€œtwo oâ€™clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter
of an hour.â€

0071m



â€œTo be sure!â€”to be sure!â€ cried DantÃ¨s, eagerly quitting the table;
â€œlet us go directly!â€

His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.

At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every
change in Fernandâ€™s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back,
with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the
open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct
sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with
the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and
buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the
bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension
quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most
deathlike stillness prevailed.

The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the
door. The company looked at each other in consternation.

â€œI demand admittance,â€ said a loud voice outside the room, â€œin the name
of the law!â€ As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened,
and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself,
followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the
most extreme dread on the part of those present.

â€œMay I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?â€ said M.
Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; â€œthere is
doubtless some mistake easily explained.â€

â€œIf it be so,â€ replied the magistrate, â€œrely upon every reparation
being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and
although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must,
nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled
answers to the name of Edmond DantÃ¨s?â€

Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation
he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm
voice:

â€œI am he; what is your pleasure with me?â€

â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s,â€ replied the magistrate, â€œI arrest you in the name of
the law!â€

â€œMe!â€ repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, â€œand wherefore, I
pray?â€

â€œI cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons
that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary
examination.â€

M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He
saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly
well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate
decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold
marble effigy. Old DantÃ¨s, however, sprang forward. There are
situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to
understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the
officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said,
â€œMy worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your
son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in
registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at
liberty directly he has given the information required, whether
touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.â€

â€œWhat is the meaning of all this?â€ inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of
Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.

0073m



â€œHow can I tell you?â€ replied he; â€œI am, like yourself, utterly
bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out
what it is about.â€ Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he
had disappeared.

The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with
startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed
appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication
of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.

â€œSo, so,â€ said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, â€œthis,
then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?
All I can say is, that if it be so, â€™tis an ill turn, and well deserves
to bring double evil on those who have projected it.â€

â€œNonsense,â€ returned Danglars, â€œI tell you again I have nothing
whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the
paper to pieces.â€

â€œNo, you did not!â€ answered Caderousse, â€œyou merely threw it byâ€”I saw
it lying in a corner.â€

â€œHold your tongue, you fool!â€”what should you know about it?â€”why, you
were drunk!â€

â€œWhere is Fernand?â€ inquired Caderousse.

â€œHow do I know?â€ replied Danglars; â€œgone, as every prudent man ought to
be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,
let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.â€

During this conversation, DantÃ¨s, after having exchanged a cheerful
shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered
himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, â€œMake
yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to
clear up, thatâ€™s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to
go so far as the prison to effect that.â€

0075m



â€œOh, to be sure!â€ responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,
â€œnothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.â€

DantÃ¨s descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and
followed by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got
in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove
off towards Marseilles.

â€œAdieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!â€ cried MercÃ©dÃ¨s, stretching out her arms
to him from the balcony.

The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken
heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, â€œGood-bye, MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”we
shall soon meet again!â€ Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the
turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.

â€œWait for me here, all of you!â€ cried M. Morrel; â€œI will take the first
conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you
word how all is going on.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right!â€ exclaimed a multitude of voices, â€œgo, and return as
quickly as you can!â€

This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of
terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old
father and MercÃ©dÃ¨s remained for some time apart, each absorbed in
grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their
eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each otherâ€™s
arms.

Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass
of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit
down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed
next to the seat on which poor MercÃ©dÃ¨s had fallen half fainting, when
released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old DantÃ¨s.
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.

â€œHe is the cause of all this miseryâ€”I am quite sure of it,â€ whispered
Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ answered the other; â€œheâ€™s too stupid to imagine
such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of
whoever wrought it.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,â€ said
Caderousse.

â€œSurely,â€ answered Danglars, â€œone cannot be held responsible for every
chance arrow shot into the air.â€

â€œYou can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebodyâ€™s
head.â€

Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every
different form.

â€œWhat think you, Danglars,â€ said one of the party, turning towards him,
â€œof this event?â€

â€œWhy,â€ replied he, â€œI think it just possible DantÃ¨s may have been
detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as
contraband.â€

â€œBut how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since
you are the shipâ€™s supercargo?â€

â€œWhy, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the
merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with
cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastretâ€™s
warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascalâ€™s; that is all I was obliged to
know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.â€

â€œNow I recollect,â€ said the afflicted old father; â€œmy poor boy told me
yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for
me!â€

â€œThere, you see,â€ exclaimed Danglars. â€œNow the mischief is out; depend
upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our
absence, and discovered poor DantÃ¨sâ€™ hidden treasures.â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her loverâ€™s
arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst
out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.

â€œCome, come,â€ said the old man, â€œbe comforted, my poor child; there is
still hope!â€

â€œHope!â€ repeated Danglars.

â€œHope!â€ faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on
his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his
countenance.

â€œGood news! good news!â€ shouted forth one of the party stationed in the
balcony on the lookout. â€œHere comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we
shall hear that our friend is released!â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him
at the door. He was very pale.

â€œWhat news?â€ exclaimed a general burst of voices.

â€œAlas, my friends,â€ replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his
head, â€œthe thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.â€

â€œOh, indeedâ€”indeed, sir, he is innocent!â€ sobbed forth MercÃ©dÃ¨s.

â€œThat I believe!â€ answered M. Morrel; â€œbut still he is chargedâ€”â€”â€

â€œWith what?â€ inquired the elder DantÃ¨s.

â€œWith being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!â€ Many of our readers
may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in
the period at which our story is dated.

A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of MercÃ©dÃ¨s; the old man sank
into a chair.

â€œAh, Danglars!â€ whispered Caderousse, â€œyou have deceived meâ€”the trick
you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old
man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am
determined to tell them all about it.â€

â€œBe silent, you simpleton!â€ cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm,
â€œor I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether
DantÃ¨s be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he
quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any
letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon
him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his
accomplices?â€

With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived
the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully,
wistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.

â€œSuppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,â€ said he, casting a
bewildered look on his companion.

â€œTo be sure!â€ answered Danglars. â€œLet us wait, by all means. If he be
innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no
use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.â€

â€œLet us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.â€

â€œWith all my heart!â€ replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so
tractable. â€œLet us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for
the present to take their course.â€

After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and
protector of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, led the girl to her home, while some friends of
DantÃ¨s conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the AllÃ©es de Meilhan.

The rumor of Edmondâ€™s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in
circulating throughout the city.

â€œCould you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?â€ asked M.
Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh
tidings of DantÃ¨s, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he
overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. â€œCould you have believed such a
thing possible?â€

â€œWhy, you know I told you,â€ replied Danglars, â€œthat I considered the
circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very
suspicious circumstance.â€

â€œAnd did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?â€

0079m



â€œCertainly not!â€ returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, â€œYou
understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who
served under the _other_ government, and who does not altogether
conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of
regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure
both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a
soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is
bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are
many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.â€

â€œâ€™Tis well, Danglarsâ€”â€™tis well!â€ replied M. Morrel. â€œYou are a worthy
fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of
poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon_.â€

â€œIs it possible you were so kind?â€

â€œYes, indeed; I had previously inquired of DantÃ¨s what was his opinion
of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your
post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.â€

â€œAnd what was his reply?â€

â€œThat he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair
which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the shipâ€™s owners
would have his preference also.â€

â€œThe hypocrite!â€ murmured Danglars.

â€œPoor DantÃ¨s!â€ said Caderousse. â€œNo one can deny his being a
noble-hearted young fellow.â€

â€œBut meanwhile,â€ continued M. Morrel, â€œhere is the _Pharaon_ without a
captain.â€

â€œOh,â€ replied Danglars, â€œsince we cannot leave this port for the next
three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period DantÃ¨s
will be set at liberty.â€

â€œNo doubt; but in the meantime?â€

â€œI am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,â€ answered Danglars. â€œYou
know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced
captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to
accept my services, that upon Edmondâ€™s release from prison no further
change will be requisite on board the _Pharaon_ than for DantÃ¨s and
myself each to resume our respective posts.â€

â€œThanks, Danglarsâ€”that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully
authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_, and look
carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must
never be allowed to interfere with business.â€

â€œBe easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be
permitted to see our poor Edmond?â€

â€œI will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I
shall endeavor to interest in Edmondâ€™s favor. I am aware he is a
furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being kingâ€™s
attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of
one.â€

â€œPerhaps not,â€ replied Danglars; â€œbut I hear that he is ambitious, and
thatâ€™s rather against him.â€

â€œWell, well,â€ returned M. Morrel, â€œwe shall see. But now hasten on
board, I will join you there ere long.â€

So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded
in the direction of the Palais de Justice.

0081m



â€œYou see,â€ said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, â€œthe turn things have
taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?â€

â€œNot the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere
joke should lead to such consequences.â€

â€œBut who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but
Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the
roomâ€”indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œthat I can answer for, you did not. I
only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed
and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.â€

â€œWell, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and
either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not
take the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he
may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting
was disguised.â€

â€œThen you were aware of DantÃ¨s being engaged in a conspiracy?â€

â€œNot I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing
more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the
truth.â€

â€œStill,â€ argued Caderousse, â€œI would give a great deal if nothing of
the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You
will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of
us.â€

â€œNonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;
and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way?
All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly
quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that
the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.â€

â€œAmen!â€ responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to
Danglars, and bending his steps towards the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, moving
his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one
whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.

â€œSo far, then,â€ said Danglars, mentally, â€œall has gone as I would have
it. I am, temporarily, commander of the _Pharaon_, with the certainty
of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded
to hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of DantÃ¨s being
released. But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,â€ added he
with a smile, â€œshe will take her own.â€ So saying, he leaped into a
boat, desiring to be rowed on board the _Pharaon_, where M. Morrel had
agreed to meet him.



 Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi

In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand
Cours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being
celebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by
DantÃ¨s. In this case, however, although the occasion of the
entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to
the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the
very flower of Marseilles society,â€”magistrates who had resigned their
office during the usurperâ€™s reign; officers who had deserted from the
imperial army and joined forces with CondÃ©; and younger members of
families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of
exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate
to the rank of a god.

The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic
conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive
passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,
for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness
to the violence of party feeling.

The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held
sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a
small population of five or six thousand souls,â€”after having been
accustomed to hear the â€œ_Vive NapolÃ©ons_â€ of a hundred and twenty
millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,â€”was
looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh
connection with France or claim to her throne.

The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military
part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while
the women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the
downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that
they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and
cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.

An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and
proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de
Saint-MÃ©ran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of
Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal
enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air _Ã  lâ€™Anglaise_, and the
ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the
table with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor
prevailed.

â€œAh,â€ said the Marquise de Saint-MÃ©ran, a woman with a stern,
forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,
despite her fifty yearsâ€”â€œah, these revolutionists, who have driven us
from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle
during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here,
that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow
the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made
their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not
help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and
station was truly our â€˜Louis the well-beloved,â€™ while their wretched
usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their
â€˜Napoleon the accursed.â€™ Am I not right, Villefort?â€

â€œI beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, butâ€”in
truthâ€”I was not attending to the conversation.â€

â€œMarquise, marquise!â€ interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the
toast, â€œlet the young people alone; let me tell you, on oneâ€™s wedding
day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry
politics.â€

â€œNever mind, dearest mother,â€ said a young and lovely girl, with a
profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid
crystal, â€œâ€™tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to
prevent his listening to what you said. But thereâ€”now take himâ€”he is
your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my
mother speaks to you.â€

â€œIf the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly
caught, I shall be delighted to answer,â€ said M. de Villefort.

â€œNever mind, RenÃ©e,â€ replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness
that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however
all other feelings may be withered in a womanâ€™s nature, there is always
one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the
shrine of maternal love. â€œI forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,
was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or
devotion.â€

â€œThey had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,â€
replied the young man, â€œand that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the
Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
personification of equality.â€

â€œHe!â€ cried the marquise: â€œNapoleon the type of equality! For mercyâ€™s
sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip
the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to
my mind, has usurped quite enough.â€

0085m



â€œNay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right
pedestalâ€”that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;
that of Napoleon on the column of the Place VendÃ´me. The only
difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated
by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the
equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the
guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.
Observe,â€ said Villefort, smiling, â€œI do not mean to deny that both
these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and
the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy
of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil
order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust
he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical
satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other
usurpersâ€”Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,
had his partisans and advocates.â€

â€œDo you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully
revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the
son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.â€ A
deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.

â€œâ€™Tis true, madame,â€ answered he, â€œthat my father was a Girondin, but
he was not among the number of those who voted for the kingâ€™s death; he
was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had
well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father
perished.â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree
at the tragic remembrance thus called up; â€œbut bear in mind, if you
please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and
proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which
I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest
adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining
the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,
the Count Noirtier became a senator.â€

â€œDear mother,â€ interposed RenÃ©e, â€œyou know very well it was agreed that
all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.â€

â€œSuffer me, also, madame,â€ replied Villefort, â€œto add my earnest
request to Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s, that you will kindly allow
the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails
recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have
laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his
political principles. He wasâ€”nay, probably may still beâ€”a Bonapartist,
and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and
style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap
exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to
regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the
parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to
separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.â€

â€œBravo, Villefort!â€ cried the marquis; â€œexcellently well said! Come,
now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring
to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and
forgetfulness of the past.â€

â€œWith all my heart,â€ replied the marquise; â€œlet the past be forever
forgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive
it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and
inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,
Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your
fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king
consented to forget the past, as I doâ€ (and here she extended to him
her hand)â€”â€œas I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should
there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the
government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence
with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected
family.â€

â€œAlas, madame,â€ returned Villefort, â€œmy profession, as well as the
times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already
successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the
offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing
yet.â€

0087m



â€œDo you, indeed, think so?â€ inquired the marquise.

â€œI am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too
near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;
from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of
persons, and assassinations in the lower.â€

â€œYou have heard, perhaps,â€ said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de
Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte dâ€™Artois,
â€œthat the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?â€

â€œYes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,â€ said M. de
Saint-MÃ©ran; â€œand where is it decided to transfer him?â€

â€œTo Saint Helena.â€

â€œFor heavenâ€™s sake, where is that?â€ asked the marquise.

â€œAn island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two
thousand leagues from here,â€ replied the count.

â€œSo much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly
to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,
of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the
sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.â€

â€œUnfortunately,â€ said Villefort, â€œthere are the treaties of 1814, and
we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.â€

â€œOh, well, we shall find some way out of it,â€ responded M. de Salvieux.
â€œThere wasnâ€™t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of
shooting the poor Duc dâ€™Enghien.â€

â€œWell,â€ said the marquise, â€œit seems probable that, by the aid of the
Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the
vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The
king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of
France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can
best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down
every attempt at conspiracyâ€”â€™tis the best and surest means of
preventing mischief.â€

â€œUnfortunately, madame,â€ answered Villefort, â€œthe strong arm of the law
is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.â€

â€œThen all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.â€

â€œNay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it
can do is to avenge the wrong done.â€

â€œOh, M. de Villefort,â€ cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to
the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de
Saint-MÃ©ran, â€œdo try and get up some famous trial while we are at
Marseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very
amusing!â€

â€œAmusing, certainly,â€ replied the young man, â€œinasmuch as, instead of
shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre,
you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distressâ€”a drama
of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed,
instead ofâ€”as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedyâ€”going home
to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he
may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,â€”is removed from your sight
merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the
executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to
bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that
should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to
offer you the choice of being present.â€

â€œFor shame, M. de Villefort!â€ said RenÃ©e, becoming quite pale; â€œdonâ€™t
you see how you are frightening us?â€”and yet you laugh.â€

â€œWhat would you have? â€™Tis like a duel. I have already recorded
sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political
conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened,
and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?â€

â€œGracious heavens, M. de Villefort,â€ said RenÃ©e, becoming more and more
terrified; â€œyou surely are not in earnest.â€

â€œIndeed I am,â€ replied the young magistrate with a smile; â€œand in the
interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would
only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as
is more than probable, to have served under Napoleonâ€”well, can you
expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his
commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will
scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be
his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely
because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one
requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in
order to lash oneâ€™s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and
power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile,
as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused
pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire
of my eloquence.â€ RenÃ©e uttered a smothered exclamation.

â€œBravo!â€ cried one of the guests; â€œthat is what I call talking to some
purpose.â€

â€œJust the person we require at a time like the present,â€ said a second.

â€œWhat a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear
Villefort!â€ remarked a third; â€œI mean the trial of the man for
murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner
had laid his hand upon him.â€

â€œOh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,â€ interposed
RenÃ©e, â€œit matters very little what is done to them; but as regards
poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed
themselves up in political intriguesâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhy, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for,
donâ€™t you see, RenÃ©e, the king is the father of his people, and he who
shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent
of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great
scale?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know anything about that,â€ replied RenÃ©e; â€œbut, M. de
Villefort, you have promised meâ€”have you not?â€”always to show mercy to
those I plead for.â€

â€œMake yourself quite easy on that point,â€ answered Villefort, with one
of his sweetest smiles; â€œyou and I will always consult upon our
verdicts.â€

â€œMy love,â€ said the marquise, â€œattend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and
embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays
the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the
badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in
point.â€

â€œ_Cedant arma togÃ¦_,â€ said Villefort with a bow.

â€œI cannot speak Latin,â€ responded the marquise.

â€œWell,â€ said RenÃ©e, â€œI cannot help regretting you had not chosen some
other profession than your ownâ€”a physician, for instance. Do you know I
always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?â€

â€œDear, good RenÃ©e,â€ whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable
tenderness on the lovely speaker.

â€œLet us hope, my child,â€ cried the marquis, â€œthat M. de Villefort may
prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he
will have achieved a noble work.â€

â€œAnd one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fatherâ€™s
conduct,â€ added the incorrigible marquise.

â€œMadame,â€ replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, â€œI have already had
the honor to observe that my father hasâ€”at least, I hope soâ€”abjured his
past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous
friend to religion and orderâ€”a better royalist, possibly, than his son;
for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse
than warm, decided preference and conviction.â€ Having made this
well-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the
effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been
addressing the bench in open court.

â€œDo you know, my dear Villefort,â€ cried the Comte de Salvieux, â€œthat is
exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when
questioned by his majestyâ€™s principal chamberlain touching the
singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the
daughter of an officer of the Duc de CondÃ©; and I assure you he seemed
fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences
was based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who,
without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted
us by saying, â€˜Villefortâ€™â€”observe that the king did not pronounce the
word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on
that of Villefortâ€”â€˜Villefort,â€™ said his majesty, â€˜is a young man of
great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his
profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that
he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de
Saint-MÃ©ran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the
noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.â€™â€

â€œIs it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express
himself so favorably of me?â€ asked the enraptured Villefort.

â€œI give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he
will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to
him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of
your espousing his daughter.â€

0091m



â€œThat is true,â€ answered the marquis.

â€œHow much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do
to evince my earnest gratitude!â€

â€œThat is right,â€ cried the marquise. â€œI love to see you thus. Now,
then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most
welcome.â€

â€œFor my part, dear mother,â€ interposed RenÃ©e, â€œI trust your wishes will
not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor
debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefortâ€™s
hands,â€”then I shall be contented.â€

â€œJust the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be
called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of
wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to
see me the kingâ€™s attorney, you must desire for me some of those
violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor
redounds to the physician.â€

At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefortâ€™s wish had
sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and
whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table
and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,
however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. RenÃ©e regarded
him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as
they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed
to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful
and intelligent lover.

â€œYou were wishing just now,â€ said Villefort, addressing her, â€œthat I
were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the
disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in
1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my
betrothal.â€

â€œAnd wherefore were you called away just now?â€ asked Mademoiselle de
Saint-MÃ©ran, with an air of deep interest.

â€œFor a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the
executioner.â€

â€œHow dreadful!â€ exclaimed RenÃ©e, turning pale.

â€œIs it possible?â€ burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to
the magistrate to hear his words.

â€œWhy, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy
has just been discovered.â€

â€œCan I believe my ears?â€ cried the marquise.

â€œI will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,â€ said
Villefort:

â€œâ€˜The kingâ€™s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the
religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond DantÃ¨s,
mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having
touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter
from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter
from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration
of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned
Edmond DantÃ¨s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him,
or has it at his fatherâ€™s abode. Should it not be found in the
possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in
the cabin belonging to the said DantÃ¨s on board the _Pharaon_.â€™â€

â€œBut,â€ said RenÃ©e, â€œthis letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous
scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the kingâ€™s attorney.â€

0093m



â€œTrue; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders,
opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me,
but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for
arresting the accused party.â€

â€œThen the guilty person is absolutely in custody?â€ said the marquise.

â€œNay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet
pronounce him guilty.â€

â€œHe is in safe custody,â€ answered Villefort; â€œand rely upon it, if the
letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again,
unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.â€

â€œAnd where is the unfortunate being?â€ asked RenÃ©e.

â€œHe is at my house.â€

â€œCome, come, my friend,â€ interrupted the marquise, â€œdo not neglect your
duty to linger with us. You are the kingâ€™s servant, and must go
wherever that service calls you.â€

â€œOh, Villefort!â€ cried RenÃ©e, clasping her hands, and looking towards
her lover with piteous earnestness, â€œbe merciful on this the day of our
betrothal.â€

The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair
pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:

â€œTo give you pleasure, my sweet RenÃ©e, I promise to show all the lenity
in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero
prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his
head to be cut off.â€

RenÃ©e shuddered at the word _cut_, for the growth in question had a
head.

â€œNever mind that foolish girl, Villefort,â€ said the marquise. â€œShe will
soon get over these things.â€ So saying, Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran extended
her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-lawâ€™s
respectful salute on it, looked at RenÃ©e, as much as to say, â€œI must
try and fancy â€™tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.â€

â€œThese are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,â€ sighed poor
RenÃ©e.

â€œUpon my word, child!â€ exclaimed the angry marquise, â€œyour folly
exceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can
possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the
state!â€

â€œOh, mother!â€ murmured RenÃ©e.

â€œNay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you that
to make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;â€
then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to
say, â€œFear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with
mercy,â€ and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, Villefort
departed with paradise in his heart.



 Chapter 7. The Examination

No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air
of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in
spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a
finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no
means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the
recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which
might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his
own career, GÃ©rard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already
rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He
was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not
passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king;
and besides her personal attractions, which were very great,
Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s family possessed considerable political
influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry
of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the
prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her
fatherâ€™s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling
of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its
contemplation.

At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to
earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, â€œI
have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this
man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the
conspiracy.â€

â€œWe know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers
found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself
is named Edmond DantÃ¨s, mate on board the three-master the _Pharaon_,
trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &
Son, of Marseilles.â€

â€œBefore he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the
marines?â€

â€œOh, no, monsieur, he is very young.â€

â€œHow old?â€

â€œNineteen or twenty at the most.â€

At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue
des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him,
approached; it was M. Morrel.

â€œAh, M. de Villefort,â€ cried he, â€œI am delighted to see you. Some of
your people have committed the strangest mistakeâ€”they have just
arrested Edmond DantÃ¨s, mate of my vessel.â€

â€œI know it, monsieur,â€ replied Villefort, â€œand I am now going to
examine him.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, â€œyou do not know
him, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature
in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman
in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your
indulgence for him.â€

Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and
replied coldly:

â€œYou are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy
in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet
be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?â€

The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply
them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the
heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of
indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear
on politics; besides, what DantÃ¨s had told him of his interview with
the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed
him. He replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:

â€œI entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and
equitable, and give him back to us soon.â€ This _give us_ sounded
revolutionary in the deputyâ€™s ears.

â€œAh, ah,â€ murmured he, â€œis DantÃ¨s then a member of some Carbonari
society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was,
if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many
others.â€ Then he added, â€œMonsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform
my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have
appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present
epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my
duty.â€

0097m



As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the
Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the
shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had
left him. The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in
the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the
prisoner. Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at
DantÃ¨s, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared,
saying, â€œBring in the prisoner.â€

Rapid as had been Villefortâ€™s glance, it had served to give him an idea
of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence
in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and
frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
Villefortâ€™s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often
warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the
impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He
stifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising,
composed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An
instant after DantÃ¨s entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and
saluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if
he had been in M. Morrelâ€™s salon. It was then that he encountered for
the first time Villefortâ€™s look,â€”that look peculiar to the magistrate,
who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of
his own.

â€œWho and what are you?â€ demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of
papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police
agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hourâ€™s
time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt
espionage of which â€œthe accusedâ€ is always made the victim.

â€œMy name is Edmond DantÃ¨s,â€ replied the young man calmly; â€œI am mate of
the _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.â€

â€œYour age?â€ continued Villefort.

â€œNineteen,â€ returned DantÃ¨s.

â€œWhat were you doing at the moment you were arrested?â€

â€œI was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,â€ said the young man,
his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that
happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great
was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the
radiant face of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.

â€œYou were at the festival of your marriage?â€ said the deputy,
shuddering in spite of himself.

â€œYes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been
attached to for three years.â€ Villefort, impassive as he was, was
struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of DantÃ¨s,
surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in
his own bosomâ€”he also was on the point of being married, and he was
summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. â€œThis
philosophic reflection,â€ thought he, â€œwill make a great sensation at M.
de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s;â€ and he arranged mentally, while DantÃ¨s awaited
further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a
reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort
turned to DantÃ¨s.

0099m



â€œGo on, sir,â€ said he.

â€œWhat would you have me say?â€

â€œGive all the information in your power.â€

â€œTell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I
know; only,â€ added he, with a smile, â€œI warn you I know very little.â€

â€œHave you served under the usurper?â€

â€œI was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.â€

â€œIt is reported your political opinions are extreme,â€ said Villefort,
who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make
this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.

â€œMy political opinions!â€ replied DantÃ¨s. â€œAlas, sir, I never had any
opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.
If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus
all my opinionsâ€”I will not say public, but privateâ€”are confined to
these three sentiments,â€”I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I
adore MercÃ©dÃ¨s. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how
uninteresting it is.â€ As DantÃ¨s spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous
and open countenance, and recollected the words of RenÃ©e, who, without
knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With
the deputyâ€™s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man
uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he
was scarcely a man,â€”simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of
the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,
because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked
goodâ€”extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefortâ€™s
severe look and stern accent. DantÃ¨s seemed full of kindness.

_â€œPardieu!â€_ said Villefort, â€œhe is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain
RenÃ©eâ€™s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on
me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet
kiss in private.â€ Full of this idea, Villefortâ€™s face became so joyous,
that when he turned to DantÃ¨s, the latter, who had watched the change
on his physiognomy, was smiling also.

â€œSir,â€ said Villefort, â€œhave you any enemies, at least, that you know.â€

â€œI have enemies?â€ replied DantÃ¨s; â€œmy position is not sufficiently
elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat
too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve
sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that
they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as
an elder brother.â€

â€œBut you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at
nineteenâ€”an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who
loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the
envy of someone.â€

â€œYou are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may
possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my
acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced
to hate them.â€

â€œYou are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You
seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty
to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the
paper; do you know the writing?â€ As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter
from his pocket, and presented it to DantÃ¨s. DantÃ¨s read it. A cloud
passed over his brow as he said:

â€œNo, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably
plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,â€ added he,
looking gratefully at Villefort, â€œto be examined by such a man as you;
for this envious person is a real enemy.â€ And by the rapid glance that
the young manâ€™s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid
beneath this mildness.

â€œNow,â€ said the deputy, â€œanswer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a
judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what
truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?â€
And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter DantÃ¨s had just
given back to him.

â€œNone at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a
sailor, by my love for MercÃ©dÃ¨s, by the life of my fatherâ€”â€”â€

â€œSpeak, monsieur,â€ said Villefort. Then, internally, â€œIf RenÃ©e could
see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a
decapitator.â€

â€œWell, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a
brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to
arrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder
rose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was
dying, he called me to him. â€˜My dear DantÃ¨s,â€™ said he, â€˜swear to
perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest
importance.â€™

â€œâ€˜I swear, captain,â€™ replied I.

â€œâ€˜Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume
the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at
Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letterâ€”perhaps
they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission.
You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor
and profit from it.â€™

â€œâ€˜I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the
grand-marshalâ€™s presence as easily as you expect?â€™

â€œâ€˜Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every
difficulty,â€™ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was
timeâ€”two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.â€

â€œAnd what did you do then?â€

â€œWhat I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my
place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with
a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for
the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody
to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found
some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent
the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly
admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclereâ€™s death; and, as
the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in
Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I
landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit
my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.
Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at
my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and
tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this
charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Villefort, â€œthis seems to me the truth. If you have been
culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to
the orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from
Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go
and rejoin your friends.

â€œI am free, then, sir?â€ cried DantÃ¨s joyfully.

â€œYes; but first give me this letter.â€

â€œYou have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I
see in that packet.â€

â€œStop a moment,â€ said the deputy, as DantÃ¨s took his hat and gloves.
â€œTo whom is it addressed?â€

_â€œTo Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-HÃ©ron, Paris.â€_ Had a thunderbolt
fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He
sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the
fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.

â€œM. Noirtier, Rue Coq-HÃ©ron, No. 13,â€ murmured he, growing still paler.

â€œYes,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œdo you know him?â€

â€œNo,â€ replied Villefort; â€œa faithful servant of the king does not know
conspirators.â€

0103m



â€œIt is a conspiracy, then?â€ asked DantÃ¨s, who after believing himself
free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. â€œI have, however, already told
you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.â€

â€œYes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,â€
said Villefort.

â€œI was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.â€

â€œHave you shown this letter to anyone?â€ asked Villefort, becoming still
more pale.

â€œTo no one, on my honor.â€

â€œEverybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the
Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?â€

â€œEverybody, except the person who gave it to me.â€

â€œAnd that was too much, far too much,â€ murmured Villefort. Villefortâ€™s
brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled
DantÃ¨s with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered
his face with his hands.

â€œOh,â€ said DantÃ¨s timidly, â€œwhat is the matter?â€ Villefort made no
answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and
again perused the letter.

â€œAnd you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?â€

â€œI give you my word of honor, sir,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œbut what is the
matter? You are illâ€”shall I ring for assistance?â€”shall I call?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Villefort, rising hastily; â€œstay where you are. It is for me
to give orders here, and not you.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ replied DantÃ¨s proudly, â€œit was only to summon assistance
for you.â€

â€œI want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;
answer me.â€ DantÃ¨s waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort
fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with
perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.

â€œOh, if he knows the contents of this!â€ murmured he, â€œand that Noirtier
is the father of Villefort, I am lost!â€ And he fixed his eyes upon
Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.

â€œOh, it is impossible to doubt it,â€ cried he, suddenly.

â€œIn heavenâ€™s name!â€ cried the unhappy young man, â€œif you doubt me,
question me; I will answer you.â€ Villefort made a violent effort, and
in a tone he strove to render firm:

â€œSir,â€ said he, â€œI am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you
immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial
justice; what my own feeling is you already know.â€

â€œOh, monsieur,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œyou have been rather a friend than a
judge.â€

0105m



â€œWell, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it
as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,
and you seeâ€”â€”â€ Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited
until it was entirely consumed.

â€œYou see, I destroy it?â€

â€œOh,â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s, â€œyou are goodness itself.â€

â€œListen,â€ continued Villefort; â€œyou can now have confidence in me after
what I have done.â€

â€œOh, command, and I will obey.â€

â€œListen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.â€

â€œSpeak, and I will follow your advice.â€

â€œI shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should
anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but
do not breathe a word of this letter.â€

â€œI promise.â€ It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner
who reassured him.

â€œYou see,â€ continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of
burnt paper fluttered in the flames, â€œthe letter is destroyed; you and
I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned,
deny all knowledge of itâ€”deny it boldly, and you are saved.â€

â€œBe satisfied; I will deny it.â€

â€œIt was the only letter you had?â€

â€œIt was.â€

â€œSwear it.â€

â€œI swear it.â€

Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words
in his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.

â€œFollow him,â€ said Villefort to DantÃ¨s. DantÃ¨s saluted Villefort and
retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself
half-fainting into a chair.

â€œAlas, alas,â€ murmured he, â€œif the procureur himself had been at
Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have
destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always
interfere with my successes?â€ Suddenly a light passed over his face, a
smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in
thought.

â€œThis will do,â€ said he, â€œand from this letter, which might have ruined
me, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand.â€ And after
having assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur
hastened to the house of his betrothed.

 Chapter 8. The ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If

The commissary of police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign
to two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on DantÃ¨sâ€™ right and the
other on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice
was opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,
whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais
de Justice communicated with the prison,â€”a sombre edifice, that from
its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After
numberless windings, DantÃ¨s saw a door with an iron wicket. The
commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow
seeming to DantÃ¨s as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two
gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud
sound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and
mephitic,â€”he was in prison.

He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred,
and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the
words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded
still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four oâ€™clock when
DantÃ¨s was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of
March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity
augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose
and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him,
but the sound died away, and DantÃ¨s sank again into his seat. At last,
about ten oâ€™clock, and just as DantÃ¨s began to despair, steps were
heard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the
massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches
pervaded the apartment.

By the torchlight DantÃ¨s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four
gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this
display of force.

â€œAre you come to fetch me?â€ asked he.

â€œYes,â€ replied a gendarme.

â€œBy the orders of the deputy procureur?â€

â€œI believe so.â€ The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort
relieved all DantÃ¨sâ€™ apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed
himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the
coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.

â€œIs this carriage for me?â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œIt is for you,â€ replied a gendarme.

DantÃ¨s was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and
having neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the
steps, and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the
two others took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily
over the stones.

The prisoner glanced at the windowsâ€”they were grated; he had changed
his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither.
Through the grating, however, DantÃ¨s saw they were passing through the
Rue Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the
quay. Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.

The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse,
a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; DantÃ¨s saw
the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.

â€œCan all this force be summoned on my account?â€ thought he.

The officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking a
word, answered DantÃ¨sâ€™ question; for he saw between the ranks of the
soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two
gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered
to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.
They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a
chain, near the quay.

The soldiers looked at DantÃ¨s with an air of stupid curiosity. In an
instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the
gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent
the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards
the Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of
the port was lowered and in a second they were, as DantÃ¨s knew, in the
Frioul and outside the inner harbor.

The prisonerâ€™s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure
airâ€”for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La
RÃ©serve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the
open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. DantÃ¨s folded his
hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.

0111m



The boat continued her voyage. They had passed the TÃªte de Mort, were
now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This
manÅ“uvre was incomprehensible to DantÃ¨s.

â€œWhither are you taking me?â€ asked he.

â€œYou will soon know.â€

â€œBut stillâ€”â€”â€

â€œWe are forbidden to give you any explanation.â€ DantÃ¨s, trained in
discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question
subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.

The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they
were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor
outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him
on some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt
to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the
deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not
pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend?
Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only
proof against him?

He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.

They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the
right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the
prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it
was there MercÃ©dÃ¨s dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn
MercÃ©dÃ¨s that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?

One light alone was visible; and DantÃ¨s saw that it came from MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™
chamber. MercÃ©dÃ¨s was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A
loud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not
utter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a
madman?

He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on,
but the prisoner thought only of MercÃ©dÃ¨s. An intervening elevation of
land hid the light. DantÃ¨s turned and perceived that they had got out
to sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their
oars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.

In spite of his repugnance to address the guards, DantÃ¨s turned to the
nearest gendarme, and taking his hand,

â€œComrade,â€ said he, â€œI adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to
tell me where we are going. I am Captain DantÃ¨s, a loyal Frenchman,
thought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I
promise you on my honor I will submit to my fate.â€

The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for
answer a sign that said, â€œI see no great harm in telling him now,â€ and
the gendarme replied:

â€œYou are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know
where you are going?â€

â€œOn my honor, I have no idea.â€

â€œHave you no idea whatever?â€

â€œNone at all.â€

â€œThat is impossible.â€

â€œI swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.â€

â€œBut my orders.â€

â€œYour orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten
minutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if
I intended.â€

â€œUnless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must
know.â€

â€œI do not.â€

â€œLook round you then.â€ DantÃ¨s rose and looked forward, when he saw rise
within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which
stands the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than
three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to
DantÃ¨s like a scaffold to a malefactor.

â€œThe ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If?â€ cried he, â€œwhat are we going there for?â€

The gendarme smiled.

â€œI am not going there to be imprisoned,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œit is only used
for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any
magistrates or judges at the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If?â€

â€œThere are only,â€ said the gendarme, â€œa governor, a garrison, turnkeys,
and good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you
will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good
nature.â€

DantÃ¨s pressed the gendarmeâ€™s hand as though he would crush it.

â€œYou think, then,â€ said he, â€œthat I am taken to the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If to be
imprisoned there?â€

â€œIt is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.â€

â€œWithout any inquiry, without any formality?â€

â€œAll the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already
made.â€

â€œAnd so, in spite of M. de Villefortâ€™s promises?â€

â€œI do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,â€ said the gendarme,
â€œbut I know we are taking you to the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If. But what are you
doing? Help, comrades, help!â€

By a rapid movement, which the gendarmeâ€™s practiced eye had perceived,
DantÃ¨s sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four
vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat. He
fell back cursing with rage.

â€œGood!â€ said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; â€œthis is the
way you keep your word as a sailor! Believe soft-spoken gentlemen
again! Hark ye, my friend, I have disobeyed my first order, but I will
not disobey the second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.â€
And he levelled his carbine at DantÃ¨s, who felt the muzzle against his
temple.

For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending
the unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M.
de Villefortâ€™s promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of
a gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing
his teeth and wringing his hands with fury.

At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of
the sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley,
and DantÃ¨s guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they
were mooring the boat.

His guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,
and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the
fortress, while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet
followed behind.

DantÃ¨s made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw
soldiers drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was
ascending a flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a
door, and that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as
through a mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier
against freedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair.

They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his
thoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls;
he heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the
light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine.

They waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain DantÃ¨s could not escape,
the gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders
came.

â€œWhere is the prisoner?â€ said a voice.

â€œHere,â€ replied the gendarmes.

â€œLet him follow me; I will take him to his cell.â€

â€œGo!â€ said the gendarmes, thrusting DantÃ¨s forward.

The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under
ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with
tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and
showed DantÃ¨s the features of his conductor, an under-jailer,
ill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.

0113m



â€œHere is your chamber for tonight,â€ said he. â€œIt is late, and the
governor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you. In the
meantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a
prisoner can wish for. Goodnight.â€ And before DantÃ¨s could open his
mouthâ€”before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the
waterâ€”before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the
jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,
leaving stamped upon the prisonerâ€™s mind the dim reflection of the
dripping walls of his dungeon.

DantÃ¨s was alone in darkness and in silenceâ€”cold as the shadows that he
felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the
jailer returned, with orders to leave DantÃ¨s where he was. He found the
prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with
weeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The
jailer advanced; DantÃ¨s appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on
the shoulder. Edmond started.

â€œHave you not slept?â€ said the jailer.

â€œI do not know,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. The jailer stared.

â€œAre you hungry?â€ continued he.

â€œI do not know.â€

â€œDo you wish for anything?â€

â€œI wish to see the governor.â€

The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber.

DantÃ¨s followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands
towards the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst
forth; he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking
himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished.

The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and
round the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular
tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so
still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,
thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained
the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish
vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where MercÃ©dÃ¨s and his father could
have joined him. He had no fears as to how he should liveâ€”good seamen
are welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish
like a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with MercÃ©dÃ¨s and
his father, whereas he was now confined in the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, that
impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and
MercÃ©dÃ¨s; and all this because he had trusted to Villefortâ€™s promise.
The thought was maddening, and DantÃ¨s threw himself furiously down on
his straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.

â€œWell,â€ said the jailer, â€œare you more reasonable today?â€ DantÃ¨s made
no reply.

â€œCome, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?â€

â€œI wish to see the governor.â€

â€œI have already told you it was impossible.â€

â€œWhy so?â€

â€œBecause it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask
for it.â€

â€œWhat is allowed, then?â€

â€œBetter fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.â€

â€œI do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to
walk about; but I wish to see the governor.â€

â€œIf you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any
more to eat.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said Edmond, â€œif you do not, I shall die of hungerâ€”that
is all.â€

The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every
prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more
subdued tone.

â€œWhat you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will
be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and
if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.â€

â€œBut,â€ asked DantÃ¨s, â€œhow long shall I have to wait?â€

â€œAh, a monthâ€”six monthsâ€”a year.â€

â€œIt is too long a time. I wish to see him at once.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the jailer, â€œdo not always brood over what is impossible, or
you will be mad in a fortnight.â€

â€œYou think so?â€

â€œYes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of
francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbÃ© became mad, who was
in this chamber before you.â€

0119m



â€œHow long has he left it?â€

â€œTwo years.â€

â€œWas he liberated, then?â€

â€œNo; he was put in a dungeon.â€

â€œListen!â€ said DantÃ¨s. â€œI am not an abbÃ©, I am not mad; perhaps I shall
be, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make you another
offer.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€

â€œI do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will give
you a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you will
seek out a young girl named MercÃ©dÃ¨s, at the Catalans, and give her two
lines from me.â€

0120m



â€œIf I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is
worth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to
run such a risk for three hundred.â€

â€œWell,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œmark this; if you refuse at least to tell
MercÃ©dÃ¨s I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and
when you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool.â€

â€œThreats!â€ cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the
defensive; â€œyou are certainly going mad. The abbÃ© began like you, and
in three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but,
fortunately, there are dungeons here.â€

DantÃ¨s whirled the stool round his head.

â€œAll right, all right,â€ said the jailer; â€œall right, since you will
have it so. I will send word to the governor.â€

â€œVery well,â€ returned DantÃ¨s, dropping the stool and sitting on it as
if he were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in an
instant with a corporal and four soldiers.

â€œBy the governorâ€™s orders,â€ said he, â€œconduct the prisoner to the tier
beneath.â€

â€œTo the dungeon, then,â€ said the corporal.

â€œYes; we must put the madman with the madmen.â€ The soldiers seized
DantÃ¨s, who followed passively.

He descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and
he was thrust in. The door closed, and DantÃ¨s advanced with
outstretched hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the
corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was
right; DantÃ¨s wanted but little of being utterly mad.



 Chapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal

Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house
found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in
the salon. RenÃ©e was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously
awaiting him, and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation.

â€œWell, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is
the matter?â€ said one. â€œSpeak out.â€

â€œAre we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?â€ asked another.

â€œHas the Corsican ogre broken loose?â€ cried a third.

â€œMarquise,â€ said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, â€œI
request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by
a few momentsâ€™ private conversation?â€

â€œAh, it is really a serious matter, then?â€ asked the marquis, remarking
the cloud on Villefortâ€™s brow.

â€œSo serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,â€ added
he, turning to RenÃ©e, â€œjudge for yourself if it be not important.â€

â€œYou are going to leave us?â€ cried RenÃ©e, unable to hide her emotion at
this unexpected announcement.

â€œAlas,â€ returned Villefort, â€œI must!â€

â€œWhere, then, are you going?â€ asked the marquise.

â€œThat, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions
for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with
pleasure undertake them.â€ The guests looked at each other.

â€œYou wish to speak to me alone?â€ said the marquis.

â€œYes, let us go to the library, please.â€ The marquis took his arm, and
they left the salon.

â€œWell,â€ asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, â€œtell me what it
is?â€

â€œAn affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate
presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you
any landed property?â€

â€œAll my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand
francs.â€

â€œThen sell outâ€”sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.â€

0123m



â€œBut how can I sell out here?â€

â€œYou have a broker, have you not?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThen give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an
instantâ€™s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.â€

â€œThe deuce you say!â€ replied the marquis, â€œlet us lose no time, then!â€

And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to
sell out at the market price.

â€œNow, then,â€ said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, â€œI
must have another!â€

â€œTo whom?â€

â€œTo the king.â€

â€œTo the king?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI dare not write to his majesty.â€

â€œI do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do
so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the kingâ€™s presence
without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would
occasion a loss of precious time.â€

â€œBut address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of
entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the
day or night.â€

â€œDoubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my
discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and
take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made
if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget
the service I do him.â€

â€œIn that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write
the letter.â€

â€œBe as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an
hour.â€

â€œTell your coachman to stop at the door.â€

â€œYou will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle RenÃ©e,
whom I leave on such a day with great regret.â€

â€œYou will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.â€

â€œA thousand thanksâ€”and now for the letter.â€

The marquis rang, a servant entered.

â€œSay to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.â€

â€œNow, then, go,â€ said the marquis.

â€œI shall be gone only a few moments.â€

Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight
of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to
throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At
his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for
him. It was MercÃ©dÃ¨s, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come
unobserved to inquire after him.

As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. DantÃ¨s had
spoken of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty
and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become
of her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the
accused.

â€œThe young man you speak of,â€ said Villefort abruptly, â€œis a great
criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.â€ MercÃ©dÃ¨s burst
into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.

â€œBut, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is
alive or dead,â€ said she.

0125m



â€œI do not know; he is no longer in my hands,â€ replied Villefort.

And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and
closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not
thus banished; like Virgilâ€™s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his
wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was
almost a sob, and sank into a chair.

Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The
man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on
the altar of his fatherâ€™s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,
leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,
not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow
and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to
the very moment of death. Then he had a momentâ€™s hesitation. He had
frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his
irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest
shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefortâ€™s brow, because they were
guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose
happiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the
executioner.

As he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and
which had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill
him with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles
instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be
healed, but Villefortâ€™s was one of those that never close, or if they
do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment
the sweet voice of RenÃ©e had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or
the fair MercÃ©dÃ¨s had entered and said, â€œIn the name of God, I conjure
you to restore me my affianced husband,â€ his cold and trembling hands
would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the
chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefortâ€™s valet, who came to
tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.

Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of
the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his
pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,
muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his
servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the
carriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s. The
hapless DantÃ¨s was doomed.

As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and RenÃ©e in
waiting. He started when he saw RenÃ©e, for he fancied she was again
about to plead for DantÃ¨s. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she
was thinking only of Villefortâ€™s departure.

She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to
become her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and
RenÃ©e, far from pleading for DantÃ¨s, hated the man whose crime
separated her from her lover.

0127m



Meanwhile what of MercÃ©dÃ¨s? She had met Fernand at the corner of the
Rue de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly
cast herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her
hand, and covered it with kisses that MercÃ©dÃ¨s did not even feel. She
passed the night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid
no heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was
day. Grief had made her blind to all but one objectâ€”that was Edmond.

â€œAh, you are there,â€ said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.

â€œI have not quitted you since yesterday,â€ returned Fernand sorrowfully.

M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that
DantÃ¨s had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends,
and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in
circulation that DantÃ¨s was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the
most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne
as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home
in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more
could be done.

Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking,
like M. Morrel, to aid DantÃ¨s, he had shut himself up with two bottles
of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did
not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and
yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows
on the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres
danced in the light of the unsnuffed candleâ€”spectres such as Hoffmann
strews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.

Danglars alone was content and joyousâ€”he had got rid of an enemy and
made his own situation on the _Pharaon_ secure. Danglars was one of
those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a
heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life
of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when,
by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.
He went to bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.

Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieuxâ€™s letter, embraced
RenÃ©e, kissed the marquiseâ€™s hand, and shaken that of the marquis,
started for Paris along the Aix road.

Old DantÃ¨s was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond.
But we know very well what had become of Edmond.



 Chapter 10. The Kingâ€™s Closet at the Tuileries

We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travellingâ€”thanks to
trebled feesâ€”with all speed, and passing through two or three
apartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched
window, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon
and Louis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.

There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from
Hartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great
people, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was
carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with
gray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire,
and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphiusâ€™s rather
inaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horaceâ€”a work which was
much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical
monarch.

â€œYou say, sirâ€”â€”â€ said the king.

â€œThat I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.â€

â€œReally, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean
kine?â€

â€œNo, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and
seven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your
majesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.â€

â€œThen of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?â€

â€œSire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the
south.â€

â€œWell, my dear duke,â€ replied Louis XVIII., â€œI think you are wrongly
informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine
weather in that direction.â€ Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII.
liked a pleasant jest.

â€œSire,â€ continued M. de Blacas, â€œif it only be to reassure a faithful
servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and DauphinÃ©,
trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling
in these three provinces?â€

â€œ_Canimus surdis_,â€ replied the king, continuing the annotations in his
Horace.

â€œSire,â€ replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem to
comprehend the quotation, â€œyour majesty may be perfectly right in
relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether
wrong in dreading some desperate attempt.â€

â€œBy whom?â€

â€œBy Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.â€

â€œMy dear Blacas,â€ said the king, â€œyou with your alarms prevent me from
working.â€

â€œAnd you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.â€

â€œWait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on
the _Pastor quum traheret_â€”wait, and I will listen to you afterwards.â€

There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as
small as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then
looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of
his own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said:

â€œGo on, my dear duke, go onâ€”I listen.â€

â€œSire,â€ said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing
Villefort to his own profit, â€œI am compelled to tell you that these are
not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a
serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to
watch over the southâ€ (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these
words), â€œhas arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens
the king, and so I hastened to you, sire.â€

â€œ_Mala ducis avi domum_,â€ continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.

â€œDoes your majesty wish me to drop the subject?â€

â€œBy no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.â€

â€œWhich?â€

â€œWhichever you pleaseâ€”there to the left.â€

â€œHere, sire?â€

â€œI tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my
leftâ€”yes, there. You will find yesterdayâ€™s report of the minister of
police. But here is M. DandrÃ© himself;â€ and M. DandrÃ©, announced by the
chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.

â€œCome in,â€ said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, â€œcome in, Baron,
and tell the duke all you knowâ€”the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do
not conceal anything, however serious,â€”let us see, the Island of Elba
is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and
bristling warâ€”_bella, horrida bella_.â€

M. DandrÃ© leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two
hands, and said:

â€œHas your majesty perused yesterdayâ€™s report?â€

â€œYes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what
the report containsâ€”give him the particulars of what the usurper is
doing in his islet.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ said the baron to the duke, â€œall the servants of his
majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the
Island of Elba. Bonaparteâ€”â€”â€

M. DandrÃ© looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did
not even raise his head. â€œBonaparte,â€ continued the baron, â€œis mortally
wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at
Porto-Longone.â€

â€œAnd scratches himself for amusement,â€ added the king.

â€œScratches himself?â€ inquired the duke, â€œwhat does your majesty mean?â€

â€œYes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this
hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries
him to death, _prurigo_?â€

â€œAnd, moreover, my dear duke,â€ continued the minister of police, â€œwe
are almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be
insane.â€

â€œInsane?â€

â€œRaving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,
sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the
seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes
â€˜duck-and-drakeâ€™ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he
had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that
these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.â€

â€œOr of wisdom, my dear baronâ€”or of wisdom,â€ said Louis XVIII.,
laughing; â€œthe greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by
casting pebbles into the oceanâ€”see Plutarchâ€™s life of Scipio
Africanus.â€

M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the
truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole
secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had
yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.

â€œWell, well, DandrÃ©,â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œBlacas is not yet convinced;
let us proceed, therefore, to the usurperâ€™s conversion.â€ The minister
of police bowed.

â€œThe usurperâ€™s conversion!â€ murmured the duke, looking at the king and
DandrÃ©, who spoke alternately, like Virgilâ€™s shepherds. â€œThe usurper
converted!â€

â€œDecidedly, my dear duke.â€

â€œIn what way converted?â€

â€œTo good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.â€

â€œWhy, this is the way of it,â€ said the minister, with the gravest air
in the world: â€œNapoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his
old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their
dismissal, and exhorted them to â€˜serve the good king.â€™ These were his
own words, of that I am certain.â€

â€œWell, Blacas, what think you of this?â€ inquired the king triumphantly,
and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.

â€œI say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am;
and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the
guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable
that I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will
interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your
majesty to do him this honor.â€

â€œMost willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person
you please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have
you any report more recent than this, dated the 20th February, and this
is the 3rd of March?â€

â€œNo, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I
left my office.â€

â€œGo thither, and if there be noneâ€”well, well,â€ continued Louis XVIII.,
â€œmake one; that is the usual way, is it not?â€ and the king laughed
facetiously.

â€œOh, sire,â€ replied the minister, â€œwe have no occasion to invent any;
every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations,
coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which
they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon
some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.â€

â€œWell, sir, goâ€; said Louis XVIII., â€œand remember that I am waiting for
you.â€

â€œI will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.â€

â€œAnd I, sire,â€ said M. de Blacas, â€œwill go and find my messenger.â€

â€œWait, sir, wait,â€ said Louis XVIII. â€œReally, M. de Blacas, I must
change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with
outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to
escape, and bearing this deviceâ€”_Tenax_.â€

0133m



â€œSire, I listen,â€ said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.

â€œI wish to consult you on this passage, â€˜_Molli fugiens anhelitu_,â€™ you
know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are you not a sportsman
and a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the _molli
anhelitu_?â€

â€œAdmirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for
he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.â€

â€œWhich is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we
have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and
that without getting in the least out of breath.â€

â€œAh, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come
so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful
information. If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him
to me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.â€

â€œM. de Salvieux, my brotherâ€™s chamberlain?â€

â€œYes, sire.â€

â€œHe is at Marseilles.â€

â€œAnd writes me thence.â€

â€œDoes he speak to you of this conspiracy?â€

â€œNo; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present
him to your majesty.â€

â€œM. de Villefort!â€ cried the king, â€œis the messengerâ€™s name M. de
Villefort?â€

â€œYes, sire.â€

â€œAnd he comes from Marseilles?â€

â€œIn person.â€

â€œWhy did you not mention his name at once?â€ replied the king, betraying
some uneasiness.

â€œSire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.â€

â€œNo, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
ambitious, too, and, _pardieu!_ you know his fatherâ€™s name!â€

â€œHis father?â€

â€œYes, Noirtier.â€

â€œNoirtier the Girondin?â€”Noirtier the senator?â€

â€œHe himself.â€

â€œAnd your majesty has employed the son of such a man?â€

â€œBlacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you
Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would
sacrifice everything, even his father.â€

â€œThen, sire, may I present him?â€

â€œThis instant, duke! Where is he?â€

â€œWaiting below, in my carriage.â€

â€œSeek him at once.â€

â€œI hasten to do so.â€

The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his
really sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis XVIII. remained
alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:

â€œ_Justum et tenacem propositi virum_.â€

M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kingâ€™s authority.
Villefortâ€™s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,
excited the susceptibility of M. de BrezÃ©, who was all astonishment at
finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king
in such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a
wordâ€”his majestyâ€™s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the
master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles,
Villefort was introduced.

The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On
opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young
magistrateâ€™s first impulse was to pause.

â€œCome in, M. de Villefort,â€ said the king, â€œcome in.â€

Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king
should interrogate him.

â€œM. de Villefort,â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œthe Duc de Blacas assures me you
have some interesting information to communicate.â€

â€œSire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it
equally important.â€

0137m



â€œIn the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as
bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?â€

â€œSire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have
used, that it is not irreparable.â€

â€œSpeak as fully as you please, sir,â€ said the king, who began to give
way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacasâ€™s face and
affected Villefortâ€™s voice. â€œSpeak, sir, and pray begin at the
beginning; I like order in everything.â€

â€œSire,â€ said Villefort, â€œI will render a faithful report to your
majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to
some obscurity in my language.â€ A glance at the king after this
discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his
august auditor, and he went on:

â€œSire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your
majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a
commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the
lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracyâ€”a
storm which menaces no less than your majestyâ€™s throne. Sire, the
usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which,
however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have
left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing
either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores
of France. Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island
of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?â€

â€œI am, sir,â€ said the king, much agitated; â€œand recently we have had
information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue
Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these
details?â€

â€œSire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a
man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on
the day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,
and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of
Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral
message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from
him; but this mission was to prepare menâ€™s minds for a return (it is
the man who says this, sire)â€”a return which will soon occur.â€

â€œAnd where is this man?â€

â€œIn prison, sire.â€

â€œAnd the matter seems serious to you?â€

â€œSo serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst
of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride
and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your
majestyâ€™s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my
devotion.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œwas there not a marriage engagement between
you and Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€

â€œDaughter of one of your majestyâ€™s most faithful servants.â€

â€œYes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.â€

â€œSire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.â€

â€œA conspiracy in these times,â€ said Louis XVIII., smiling, â€œis a thing
very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end,
inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors,
we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the
future. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their
vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If
Bonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before
he could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an
unfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful
of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is
by the population. Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our
royal gratitude.â€

â€œAh, here is M. DandrÃ©!â€ cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister
of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to
faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his
hand, restrained him.



 Chapter 11. The Corsican Ogre

At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently
the table at which he was sitting.

â€œWhat ails you, baron?â€ he exclaimed. â€œYou appear quite aghast. Has
your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and
M. de Villefort has just confirmed?â€ M. de Blacas moved suddenly
towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the
forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much
more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over
him than that he should humiliate the prefect.

â€œSire,â€”â€”â€ stammered the baron.

â€œWell, what is it?â€ asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving
way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of
Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.

â€œWill you speak?â€ he said.

â€œOh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I
can never forgive myself!â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œI command you to speak.â€

â€œWell, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on
the 1st of March.â€

â€œAnd where? In Italy?â€ asked the king eagerly.

â€œIn France, sire,â€”at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.â€

â€œThe usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two
hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only
acquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you
tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you
have gone mad.â€

â€œAlas, sire, it is but too true!â€ Louis made a gesture of indescribable
anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had
struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.

â€œIn France!â€ he cried, â€œthe usurper in France! Then they did not watch
over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.â€

â€œOh, sire,â€ exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, â€œM. DandrÃ© is not a man to be
accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of
police has shared the general blindness, that is all.â€

â€œButâ€”â€”â€ said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was
silent; then he continued, â€œYour pardon, sire,â€ he said, bowing, â€œmy
zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?â€

â€œSpeak, sir, speak boldly,â€ replied Louis. â€œYou alone forewarned us of
the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.â€

â€œSire,â€ said Villefort, â€œthe usurper is detested in the south; and it
seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to
raise Languedoc and Provence against him.â€

â€œYes, assuredly,â€ replied the minister; â€œbut he is advancing by Gap and
Sisteron.â€

â€œAdvancingâ€”he is advancing!â€ said Louis XVIII. â€œIs he then advancing on
Paris?â€ The minister of police maintained a silence which was
equivalent to a complete avowal.

â€œAnd DauphinÃ©, sir?â€ inquired the king, of Villefort. â€œDo you think it
possible to rouse that as well as Provence?â€

â€œSire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in
DauphinÃ© is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The
mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.â€

â€œThen,â€ murmured Louis, â€œhe was well informed. And how many men had he
with him?â€

â€œI do not know, sire,â€ answered the minister of police.

â€œWhat, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on
that point? Of course it is of no consequence,â€ he added, with a
withering smile.

â€œSire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact
of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.â€

â€œAnd how did this despatch reach you?â€ inquired the king. The minister
bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he
stammered out:

â€œBy the telegraph, sire.â€ Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his
arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.

0141m



â€œSo then,â€ he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, â€œseven conjoined and
allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on
the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have,
during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the
people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now,
when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I
hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!â€

â€œSire, it is fatality!â€ murmured the minister, feeling that the
pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too
much for any human strength to endure.

â€œWhat our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,
forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console
myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places
of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over
themselves,â€”for my fortune is theirsâ€”before me they were nothingâ€”after
me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from
incapacityâ€”ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir, you are rightâ€”it is fatality!â€

The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas
wiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for
he felt his increased importance.

â€œTo fall,â€ continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded
the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,â€”â€œto fall, and learn of
that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my
brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries
driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sirâ€”why, you know not its power in
France, and yet you ought to know it!â€

â€œSire, sire,â€ murmured the minister, â€œfor pityâ€™sâ€”â€”â€

â€œApproach, M. de Villefort,â€ resumed the king, addressing the young
man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on
which depended the destiny of a kingdom. â€œApproach, and tell monsieur
that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.â€

â€œSire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man
concealed from all the world.â€

â€œReally impossible! Yesâ€”that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there
are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really
impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen
hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going
on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is
a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposalâ€”a
gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all
your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had
the power of directing a telegraph.â€ The look of the minister of police
was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in
modest triumph.

â€œI do not mean that for you, Blacas,â€ continued Louis XVIII.; â€œfor if
you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to
persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have
considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else
dictated by venal ambition.â€ These words were an allusion to the
sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much
confidence an hour before.

Villefort understood the kingâ€™s intent. Any other person would,
perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise;
but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police
minister, although he saw that DandrÃ© was irrevocably lost. In fact,
the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to
unearth Napoleonâ€™s secret, might in despair at his own downfall
interrogate DantÃ¨s and so lay bare the motives of Villefortâ€™s plot.
Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen
minister, instead of aiding to crush him.

â€œSire,â€ said Villefort, â€œthe suddenness of this event must prove to
your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your
majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is
simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good
and devoted servantâ€”thatâ€™s all. Do not attribute to me more than I
deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the
first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.â€ The minister of
police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort
understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that
without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of
one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.

â€œâ€™Tis well,â€ resumed the king. â€œAnd now, gentlemen,â€ he continued,
turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, â€œI have no
further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is
in the department of the minister of war.â€

â€œFortunately, sire,â€ said M. de Blacas, â€œwe can rely on the army; your
majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.â€

â€œDo not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to
place in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned
with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?â€

â€œThe affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!â€ exclaimed Villefort, unable to
repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, â€œYour pardon,
sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the
respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the
rules of etiquette.â€

â€œGo on, go on, sir,â€ replied the king; â€œyou have today earned the right
to make inquiries here.â€

â€œSire,â€ interposed the minister of police, â€œI came a moment ago to give
your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when
your majestyâ€™s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has
occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your
majesty.â€

â€œOn the contrary, sir,â€”on the contrary,â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œthis
affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which
occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps,
put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.â€ At the name
of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.

â€œEverything points to the conclusion, sire,â€ said the minister of
police, â€œthat death was not the result of suicide, as we first
believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just
left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been
with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue
Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the generalâ€™s valet, who was dressing his
hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street
mentioned, but did not catch the number.â€ As the police minister
related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life
hung on the speakerâ€™s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king
looked towards him.

â€œDo you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom
they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely
devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?â€

â€œIt is probable, sire,â€ replied Villefort. â€œBut is this all that is
known?â€

â€œThey are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.â€

â€œOn his track?â€ said Villefort.

â€œYes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty
to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy
eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an
officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly
corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight
of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-HÃ©ron.â€
Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of
police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he
learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who
followed him, he breathed again.

â€œContinue to seek for this man, sir,â€ said the king to the minister of
police; â€œfor if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would
have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his
assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.â€ It required
all Villefortâ€™s coolness not to betray the terror with which this
declaration of the king inspired him.

â€œHow strange,â€ continued the king, with some asperity; â€œthe police
think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, â€˜A
murder has been committed,â€™ and especially so when they can add, â€˜And
we are on the track of the guilty persons.â€™â€

â€œSire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at
least.â€

â€œWe shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you
must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you
stopped at your fatherâ€™s?â€ A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.

0145m



â€œNo, sire,â€ he replied, â€œI alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue
de Tournon.â€

â€œBut you have seen him?â€

â€œSire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.â€

â€œBut you will see him, then?â€

â€œI think not, sire.â€

â€œAh, I forgot,â€ said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all
these questions were not made without a motive; â€œI forgot you and M.
Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another
sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be
recompensed.â€

â€œSire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a
recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have
nothing more to ask for.â€

â€œNever mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the
meanwhileâ€ (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor
which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,
above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave
it to Villefort)â€”â€œin the meanwhile take this cross.â€

â€œSire,â€ said Villefort, â€œyour majesty mistakes; this is an officerâ€™s
cross.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_â€ said Louis XVIII., â€œtake it, such as it is, for I have not
the time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see
that the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.â€ Villefortâ€™s
eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and
kissed it.

â€œAnd now,â€ he said, â€œmay I inquire what are the orders with which your
majesty deigns to honor me?â€

â€œTake what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to
serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at
Marseilles.â€

â€œSire,â€ replied Villefort, bowing, â€œin an hour I shall have quitted
Paris.â€

â€œGo, sir,â€ said the king; â€œand should I forget you (kingsâ€™ memories are
short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron,
send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.â€

â€œAh, sir,â€ said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the
Tuileries, â€œyou entered by luckâ€™s doorâ€”your fortune is made.â€

â€œWill it be long first?â€ muttered Villefort, saluting the minister,
whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach. One
passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the
driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to
dreams of ambition.

Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to
be ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him.
He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp
and loud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard someone speak
his name.

0147m



â€œWho could know that I was here already?â€ said the young man. The valet
entered.

â€œWell,â€ said Villefort, â€œwhat is it?â€”Who rang?â€”Who asked for me?â€

â€œA stranger who will not send in his name.â€

â€œA stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?â€

â€œHe wishes to speak to you.â€

â€œTo me?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œDid he mention my name?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhat sort of person is he?â€

â€œWhy, sir, a man of about fifty.â€

â€œShort or tall?â€

â€œAbout your own height, sir.â€

â€œDark or fair?â€

â€œDark,â€”very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.â€

â€œAnd how dressed?â€ asked Villefort quickly.

â€œIn a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of
Honor.â€

â€œIt is he!â€ said Villefort, turning pale.

0148m



â€œEh, _pardieu!_â€ said the individual whose description we have twice
given, entering the door, â€œwhat a great deal of ceremony! Is it the
custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their
anterooms?â€

â€œFather!â€ cried Villefort, â€œthen I was not deceived; I felt sure it
must be you.â€

â€œWell, then, if you felt so sure,â€ replied the new-comer, putting his
cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, â€œallow me to say, my dear
GÃ©rard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the
door.â€

â€œLeave us, Germain,â€ said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment
with evident signs of astonishment.



 Chapter 12. Father and Son

M. Noirtierâ€”for it was, indeed, he who enteredâ€”looked after the servant
until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might
be overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the
precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who
proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first
parents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the
antechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his
hand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which
he could not conceal.

â€œWell, now, my dear GÃ©rard,â€ said he to the young man, with a very
significant look, â€œdo you know, you seem as if you were not very glad
to see me?â€

â€œMy dear father,â€ said Villefort, â€œI am, on the contrary, delighted;
but I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.â€

â€œBut, my dear fellow,â€ replied M. Noirtier, seating himself, â€œI might
say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the
28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris.â€

â€œAnd if I have come, my dear father,â€ said GÃ©rard, drawing closer to M.
Noirtier, â€œdo not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my
journey will be your salvation.â€

â€œAh, indeed!â€ said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease in
the chair. â€œReally, pray tell me all about it, for it must be
interesting.â€

â€œFather, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue
Saint-Jacques?â€

â€œNo. 53; yes, I am vice-president.â€

â€œFather, your coolness makes me shudder.â€

â€œWhy, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers,
has escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of
Bordeaux by Robespierreâ€™s bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most
things. But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?â€

â€œWhy, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel,
who quitted his own house at nine oâ€™clock in the evening, was found the
next day in the Seine.â€

0151m



â€œAnd who told you this fine story?â€

â€œThe king himself.â€

â€œWell, then, in return for your story,â€ continued Noirtier, â€œI will
tell you another.â€

â€œMy dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.â€

â€œAh, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?â€

â€œNot so loud, father, I entreat of youâ€”for your own sake as well as
mine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for
three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible
speed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.â€

â€œThree days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not
landed.â€

â€œNo matter, I was aware of his intention.â€

â€œHow did you know about it?â€

â€œBy a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.â€

â€œTo me?â€

â€œTo you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.
Had that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father,
would probably ere this have been shot.â€ Villefortâ€™s father laughed.

â€œCome, come,â€ said he, â€œwill the Restoration adopt imperial methods so
promptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you
speak of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing
to pass you.â€

â€œI burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that
letter must have led to your condemnation.â€

â€œAnd the destruction of your future prospects,â€ replied Noirtier; â€œyes,
I can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to fear while I have
you to protect me.â€

â€œI do better than that, sirâ€”I save you.â€

â€œYou do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramaticâ€”explain
yourself.â€

â€œI must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.â€

â€œIt appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didnâ€™t
they search more vigilantly? they would have foundâ€”â€”â€

â€œThey have not found; but they are on the track.â€

â€œYes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the
police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the
government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a
sneaking air, that the track is lost.â€

â€œYes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in
all countries they call that a murder.â€

â€œA murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the
general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having
thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to
swim.â€

â€œFather, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown
himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month
of January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense
of the word.â€

â€œAnd who thus designated it?â€

â€œThe king himself.â€

â€œThe king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was
no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well
as I do, there are no men, but ideasâ€”no feelings, but interests; in
politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.
Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell
you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was
recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and
invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.
He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the
projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the
fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at
each other,â€”he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an
ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and
yet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart freeâ€”perfectly
free. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear
fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, thatâ€™s all. A murder?
really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found
an accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you
were fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of
one of my party, â€˜My son, you have committed a murder?â€™ No, I said,
â€˜Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it
will be our turn.â€™â€

â€œBut, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be
sweeping.â€

â€œI do not understand you.â€

â€œYou rely on the usurperâ€™s return?â€

â€œWe do.â€

â€œYou are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of
France without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.â€

â€œMy dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;
on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at
Paris.â€

â€œThe people will rise.â€

â€œYes, to go and meet him.â€

â€œHe has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched
against him.â€

â€œYes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear GÃ©rard, you are
but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has
told you, three days after the landing, â€˜The usurper has landed at
Cannes with several men. He is pursued.â€™ But where is he? what is he
doing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to
Paris, without drawing a trigger.â€

â€œGrenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an
impassable barrier.â€

â€œGrenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmâ€”all Lyons will
hasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and
our police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,
you wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your
arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your
direction to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in
proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,
then, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will
dine together.â€

â€œIndeed!â€ replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,
â€œyou really do seem very well informed.â€

â€œEh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the
means that money producesâ€”we who are in expectation, have those which
devotion prompts.â€

â€œDevotion!â€ said Villefort, with a sneer.

â€œYes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful
ambition.â€

And Villefortâ€™s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon
the servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.

â€œWait, my dear father,â€ said the young man, â€œone word more.â€

â€œSay on.â€

â€œHowever stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible
thing.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€

â€œThe description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General
Quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.â€

â€œOh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may
be that description?â€

â€œDark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor
in his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.â€

â€œAh, ha, thatâ€™s it, is it?â€ said Noirtier; â€œand why, then, have they
not laid hands on him?â€

â€œBecause yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the
corner of the Rue Coq-HÃ©ron.â€

â€œDidnâ€™t I say that your police were good for nothing?â€

â€œYes; but they may catch him yet.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, â€œtrue, if this
person were not on his guard, as he is;â€ and he added with a smile, â€œHe
will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.â€ At
these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went
towards a table on which lay his sonâ€™s toilet articles, lathered his
face, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising
whiskers. Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.

His whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,
instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top
of an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned
frock-coat, a coat of Villefortâ€™s of dark brown, and cut away in front;
tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his sonâ€™s, which
appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner
where he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the
air with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger
which was one of his principal characteristics.

â€œWell,â€ he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise
was completed, â€œwell, do you think your police will recognize me now.â€

â€œNo, father,â€ stammered Villefort; â€œat least, I hope not.â€

â€œAnd now, my dear boy,â€ continued Noirtier, â€œI rely on your prudence to
remove all the things which I leave in your care.â€

â€œOh, rely on me,â€ said Villefort.

â€œYes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really
saved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.â€

Villefort shook his head.

â€œYou are not convinced yet?â€

â€œI hope at least, that you may be mistaken.â€

â€œShall you see the king again?â€

â€œPerhaps.â€

â€œWould you pass in his eyes for a prophet?â€

â€œProphets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.â€

â€œTrue, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second
restoration, you would then pass for a great man.â€

â€œWell, what should I say to the king?â€

â€œSay this to him: â€˜Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,
as to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he
whom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled the
usurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at
Grenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing
as rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with
hunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of
snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave
France to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but
by right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your
adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be
humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of
Arcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.â€™ Tell him this, GÃ©rard; or, rather, tell
him nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have
come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter
Marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,
quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time,
I swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.
Go, my sonâ€”go, my dear GÃ©rard, and by your obedience to my paternal
orders, or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in
your place. This will be,â€ added Noirtier, with a smile, â€œone means by
which you may a second time save me, if the political balance should
some day take another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down.
Adieu, my dear GÃ©rard, and at your next journey alight at my door.â€

Noirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness
that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and
trying conversation. Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window,
put aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or
three ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there,
perhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat,
and hat with broad brim.

Villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared
at the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left
behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of
the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into
small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and
calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was
ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,
learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst
of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached
Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the
heart of man with ambition and its first successes.



 Chapter 13. The Hundred Days

M. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he
had predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from
Elba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably
remain without a counterpart in the future.

Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;
the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of
ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,
therefore, gained nothing save the kingâ€™s gratitude (which was rather
likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion
of Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas
had duly forwarded the brevet.

Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it
not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
Girondin of â€™93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had
been his protector. All Villefortâ€™s influence barely enabled him to
stifle the secret DantÃ¨s had so nearly divulged. The kingâ€™s procureur
alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.

However, scarcely was the imperial power establishedâ€”that is, scarcely
had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from
the closet into which we have introduced our readers,â€”he found on the
table there Louis XVIII.â€™s half-filled snuff-box,â€”scarcely had this
occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to
rekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and
it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater
violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the
royalists whenever they ventured abroad.

0159m



Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that momentâ€”we
will not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a
timid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of
Bonaparte accused him of â€œmoderationâ€â€”but sufficiently influential to
make a demand in favor of DantÃ¨s.

Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more
favorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, GÃ©rard
required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.
returned, the influence of M. de Saint-MÃ©ran, like his own, could be
vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy
procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one
morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.

Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man
of ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made
Morrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for
the simple reason that the kingâ€™s procureur always makes everyone wait,
and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he
ordered M. Morrel to be admitted.

Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had
found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial
politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the
well-bred from the vulgar man.

He had entered Villefortâ€™s office expecting that the magistrate would
tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder
all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his
desk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;
Villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;
then, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned
his hat in his hands,

â€œM. Morrel, I believe?â€ said Villefort.

â€œYes, sir.â€

â€œCome nearer,â€ said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the
hand, â€œand tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.â€

â€œDo you not guess, monsieur?â€ asked Morrel.

â€œNot in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be
delighted.â€

â€œEverything depends on you.â€

â€œExplain yourself, pray.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, â€œdo
you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the
emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who
was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of
Elba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor. You
then served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favorâ€”it was your
duty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect himâ€”it is
equally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?â€

0161m



Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. â€œWhat is his
name?â€ said he. â€œTell me his name.â€

â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s.â€

Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a
pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but
he did not blanch.

â€œDantÃ¨s,â€ repeated he, â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s.â€

â€œYes, monsieur.â€ Villefort opened a large register, then went to a
table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to
Morrel,

â€œAre you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?â€ said he, in the
most natural tone in the world.

Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these
matters, he would have been surprised at the kingâ€™s procureur answering
him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the
prison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in
his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the otherâ€™s
condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.

â€œNo,â€ said Morrel; â€œI am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,
the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I
came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to
plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were
very severe with the Bonapartists in those days.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ returned Villefort, â€œI was then a royalist, because I
believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen
of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the
legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right!â€ cried Morrel. â€œI like to hear you speak thus, and I
augur well for Edmond from it.â€

â€œWait a moment,â€ said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;
â€œI have itâ€”a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I
recollect now; it was a very serious charge.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œYou know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de
Justice.â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œI made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was
carried off.â€

â€œCarried off!â€ said Morrel. â€œWhat can they have done with him?â€

â€œOh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the
Sainte-MarguÃ©rite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take
command of your vessel.â€

â€œCome when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not
already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be
to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.â€

â€œDo not be too hasty, M. Morrel,â€ replied Villefort. â€œThe order of
imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation
must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been
reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Morrel, â€œis there no way of expediting all these
formalitiesâ€”of releasing him from arrest?â€

â€œThere has been no arrest.â€

â€œHow?â€

â€œIt is sometimes essential to government to cause a manâ€™s disappearance
without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may
defeat their wishes.â€

â€œIt might be so under the Bourbons, but at presentâ€”â€”â€

â€œIt has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis
himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the
register is incalculable.â€ Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much
kindness would have dispelled them.

â€œWell, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?â€ asked he.

â€œPetition the minister.â€

â€œOh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions
every day, and does not read three.â€

â€œThat is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented
by me.â€

â€œAnd will you undertake to deliver it?â€

â€œWith the greatest pleasure. DantÃ¨s was then guilty, and now he is
innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn
him.â€ Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,
however improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him
defenceless.

â€œBut how shall I address the minister?â€

â€œSit down there,â€ said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, â€œand
write what I dictate.â€

â€œWill you be so good?â€

â€œCertainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.â€

â€œThat is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be
suffering.â€

Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw
back. DantÃ¨s must be crushed to gratify Villefortâ€™s ambition.

Villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,
no doubt, DantÃ¨sâ€™ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made
out one of the most active agents of Napoleonâ€™s return. It was evident
that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release
him. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.

â€œThat will do,â€ said he; â€œleave the rest to me.â€

â€œWill the petition go soon?â€

â€œToday.â€

â€œCountersigned by you?â€

â€œThe best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents
of your petition.â€ And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate
at the bottom.

â€œWhat more is to be done?â€

â€œI will do whatever is necessary.â€ This assurance delighted Morrel, who
took leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old DantÃ¨s that he
would soon see his son.

As for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved
the petition that so fearfully compromised DantÃ¨s, in the hopes of an
event that seemed not unlikely,â€”that is, a second restoration. DantÃ¨s
remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis
XVIII.â€™s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.

Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice
had Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,
and Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any
fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.

Louis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had
become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the
situation of kingâ€™s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards
he married Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ran, whose father now stood higher
at court than ever.

And so DantÃ¨s, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in
his dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.

Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that
overwhelmed DantÃ¨s; and, when Napoleon returned to France, he, after
the manner of mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, _a decree of
Providence_. But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglarsâ€™ heart
failed him, and he lived in constant fear of DantÃ¨sâ€™ return on a
mission of vengeance. He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to
quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish
merchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March, that is,
ten or twelve days after Napoleonâ€™s return. He then left for Madrid,
and was no more heard of.

Fernand understood nothing except that DantÃ¨s was absent. What had
become of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the
absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of
deceiving MercÃ©dÃ¨s as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of
emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and
motionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence
Marseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of
a young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of
vengeance. Fernandâ€™s mind was made up; he would shoot DantÃ¨s, and then
kill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never
kills himself, for he constantly hopes.

During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man
in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the
emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible
thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and
marry MercÃ©dÃ¨s. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have
done so when he parted from MercÃ©dÃ¨s. His devotion, and the compassion
he showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce
on noble mindsâ€”MercÃ©dÃ¨s had always had a sincere regard for Fernand,
and this was now strengthened by gratitude.

â€œMy brother,â€ said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,
â€œbe careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the
world.â€ These words carried a ray of hope into Fernandâ€™s heart. Should
DantÃ¨s not return, MercÃ©dÃ¨s might one day be his.

0165m



MercÃ©dÃ¨s was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never
seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in
tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute
and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times
gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to
cast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was
not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into
execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.

Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married
and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old DantÃ¨s,
who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleonâ€™s downfall.
Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the
hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™ arms. M. Morrel
paid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old
man had contracted.

There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the
south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of
so dangerous a Bonapartist as DantÃ¨s, was stigmatized as a crime.



 Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners

A year after Louis XVIII.â€™s restoration, a visit was made by the
inspector-general of prisons. DantÃ¨s in his cell heard the noise of
preparation,â€”sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been
inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash
of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon.
He guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had
so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked
upon himself as dead.

The inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of
several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended
them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,
and if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that
the fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.

The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook
their heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector
turned smilingly to the governor.

â€œI do not know what reason government can assign for these useless
visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,â€”always the same
thing,â€”ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?â€

â€œYes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.â€

â€œLet us visit them,â€ said the inspector with an air of fatigue. â€œWe
must play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.â€

â€œLet us first send for two soldiers,â€ said the governor. â€œThe prisoners
sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be
sentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall
a victim.â€

â€œTake all needful precautions,â€ replied the inspector.

Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a
stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,
smell, and respiration.

â€œOh,â€ cried the inspector, â€œwho can live here?â€

â€œA most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most
strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.â€

â€œHe is alone?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œHow long has he been there?â€

â€œNearly a year.â€

â€œWas he placed here when he first arrived?â€

â€œNo; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to
him.â€

â€œTo kill the turnkey?â€

â€œYes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?â€ asked
the governor.

â€œTrue enough; he wanted to kill me!â€ returned the turnkey.

â€œHe must be mad,â€ said the inspector.

â€œHe is worse than that,â€”he is a devil!â€ returned the turnkey.

â€œShall I complain of him?â€ demanded the inspector.

â€œOh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another
year he will be quite so.â€

â€œSo much the better for him,â€”he will suffer less,â€ said the inspector.
He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every
way fit for his office.

â€œYou are right, sir,â€ replied the governor; â€œand this remark proves
that you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon
about twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair,
an old abbÃ©, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here
since 1811, and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He
used to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had
better see him, for his madness is amusing.â€

â€œI will see them both,â€ returned the inspector; â€œI must conscientiously
perform my duty.â€

This was the inspectorâ€™s first visit; he wished to display his
authority.

â€œLet us visit this one first,â€ added he.

â€œBy all means,â€ replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to
open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the
creaking of the hinges, DantÃ¨s, who was crouched in a corner of the
dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a
narrow iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted
by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to
whom the governor spoke bareheaded, DantÃ¨s, who guessed the truth, and
that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was
come, sprang forward with clasped hands.

The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was
about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three
steps. DantÃ¨s saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing
all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the
inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.

The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,
observed, â€œHe will become religiousâ€”he is already more gentle; he is
afraid, and retreated before the bayonetsâ€”madmen are not afraid of
anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.â€ Then,
turning to the prisoner, â€œWhat is it you want?â€ said he.

â€œI want to know what crime I have committedâ€”to be tried; and if I am
guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.â€

â€œAre you well fed?â€ said the inspector.

â€œI believe so; I donâ€™t know; itâ€™s of no consequence. What matters
really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is
that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an
infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.â€

â€œYou are very humble today,â€ remarked the governor; â€œyou are not so
always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the
turnkey.â€

â€œIt is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very
good to me, but I was mad.â€

â€œAnd you are not so any longer?â€

â€œNo; captivity has subdued meâ€”I have been here so long.â€

â€œSo long?â€”when were you arrested, then?â€ asked the inspector.

â€œThe 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.â€

â€œToday is the 30th of July, 1816,â€”why, it is but seventeen months.â€

â€œOnly seventeen months,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. â€œOh, you do not know what is
seventeen months in prison!â€”seventeen ages rather, especially to a man
who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambitionâ€”to a man, who,
like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an
honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instantâ€”who
sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his
affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen
monthsâ€™ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a
worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then,
and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a
verdictâ€”a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be
denied to one who is accused!â€

â€œWe shall see,â€ said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, â€œOn
my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against
him.â€

â€œCertainly; but you will find terrible charges.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ continued DantÃ¨s, â€œI know it is not in your power to
release me; but you can plead for meâ€”you can have me triedâ€”and that is
all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned.
Uncertainty is worse than all.â€

â€œGo on with the lights,â€ said the inspector.

â€œMonsieur,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œI can tell by your voice you are touched
with pity; tell me at least to hope.â€

â€œI cannot tell you that,â€ replied the inspector; â€œI can only promise to
examine into your case.â€

â€œOh, I am freeâ€”then I am saved!â€

â€œWho arrested you?â€

â€œM. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.â€

â€œM. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.â€

â€œI am no longer surprised at my detention,â€ murmured DantÃ¨s, â€œsince my
only protector is removed.â€

â€œHad M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?â€

â€œNone; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.â€

â€œI can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?â€

â€œEntirely.â€

â€œThat is well; wait patiently, then.â€

DantÃ¨s fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but
this time a fresh inmate was left with DantÃ¨sâ€”Hope.

0173m



â€œWill you see the register at once,â€ asked the governor, â€œor proceed to
the other cell?â€

â€œLet us visit them all,â€ said the inspector. â€œIf I once went up those
stairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.â€

â€œAh, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting
than this oneâ€™s display of reason.â€

â€œWhat is his folly?â€

â€œHe fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered
government a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the
third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of
captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five
millions.â€

â€œHow curious!â€”what is his name?â€

â€œThe AbbÃ© Faria.â€

â€œNo. 27,â€ said the inspector.

â€œIt is here; unlock the door, Antoine.â€

The turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber
of the _mad abbÃ©_, as the prisoner was usually called.

In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of
plaster detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments
scarcely covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines,
and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the
soldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the
door, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches
lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then,
raising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons
present. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it
round him.

â€œWhat is it you want?â€ said the inspector.

â€œI, monsieur,â€ replied the abbÃ© with an air of surprise,â€”â€œI want
nothing.â€

â€œYou do not understand,â€ continued the inspector; â€œI am sent here by
government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the
prisoners.â€

â€œOh, that is different,â€ cried the abbÃ©; â€œand we shall understand each
other, I hope.â€

â€œThere, now,â€ whispered the governor, â€œit is just as I told you.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ continued the prisoner, â€œI am the AbbÃ© Faria, born at Rome.
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadaâ€™s secretary; I was arrested, why,
I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have
demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.â€

â€œWhy from the French government?â€

â€œBecause I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and
Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the inspector, â€œyou have not the latest news from Italy?â€

â€œMy information dates from the day on which I was arrested,â€ returned
the AbbÃ© Faria; â€œand as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for
his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli
and CÃ¦sar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ returned the inspector, â€œProvidence has changed this
gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.â€

â€œIt is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and
independent.â€

â€œVery possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire
if you have anything to ask or to complain of.â€

â€œThe food is the same as in other prisons,â€”that is, very bad; the
lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon;
but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to
reveal of the greatest importance.â€

â€œWe are coming to the point,â€ whispered the governor.

â€œIt is for that reason I am delighted to see you,â€ continued the abbÃ©,
â€œalthough you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which,
if it succeeded, would possibly change Newtonâ€™s system. Could you allow
me a few words in private.â€

â€œWhat did I tell you?â€ said the governor.

â€œYou knew him,â€ returned the inspector with a smile.

â€œWhat you ask is impossible, monsieur,â€ continued he, addressing Faria.

0175m



â€œBut,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œI would speak to you of a large sum, amounting
to five millions.â€

â€œThe very sum you named,â€ whispered the inspector in his turn.

â€œHowever,â€ continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to
depart, â€œit is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the
governor can be present.â€

â€œUnfortunately,â€ said the governor, â€œI know beforehand what you are
about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?â€ Faria fixed his
eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of
his sanity.

â€œOf course,â€ said he; â€œof what else should I speak?â€

â€œMr. Inspector,â€ continued the governor, â€œI can tell you the story as
well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five
years.â€

â€œThat proves,â€ returned the abbÃ©, â€œthat you are like those of Holy
Writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.â€

â€œMy dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,â€
replied the inspector; â€œkeep them until you are liberated.â€ The abbÃ©â€™s
eyes glistened; he seized the inspectorâ€™s hand.

â€œBut what if I am not liberated,â€ cried he, â€œand am detained here until
my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit
by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the
rest, if they will only give me my liberty.â€

â€œOn my word,â€ said the inspector in a low tone, â€œhad I not been told
beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.â€

â€œI am not mad,â€ replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar
to prisoners. â€œThe treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to
sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot
where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,â€”I ask
no more.â€

The governor laughed. â€œIs the spot far from here?â€

â€œA hundred leagues.â€

â€œIt is not ill-planned,â€ said the governor. â€œIf all the prisoners took
it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians
consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of
escaping.â€

â€œThe scheme is well known,â€ said the inspector; â€œand the abbÃ©â€™s plan
has not even the merit of originality.â€

Then turning to Faria, â€œI inquired if you are well fed?â€ said he.

â€œSwear to me,â€ replied Faria, â€œto free me if what I tell you prove
true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.â€

â€œAre you well fed?â€ repeated the inspector.

â€œMonsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so
there is no chance of my escaping.â€

â€œYou do not reply to my question,â€ replied the inspector impatiently.

â€œNor you to mine,â€ cried the abbÃ©. â€œYou will not accept my gold; I will
keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.â€ And
the abbÃ©, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued
his calculations.

0177m



â€œWhat is he doing there?â€ said the inspector.

â€œCounting his treasures,â€ replied the governor.

Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They
went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.

â€œHe was wealthy once, perhaps?â€ said the inspector.

â€œOr dreamed he was, and awoke mad.â€

â€œAfter all,â€ said the inspector, â€œif he had been rich, he would not
have been here.â€

So the matter ended for the AbbÃ© Faria. He remained in his cell, and
this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.

Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the
impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his
wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern
times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither
courage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the
eye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves
sprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are
not inviolable.

It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer
the victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition
rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and
their flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its
cell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy
hospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the
mutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the
AbbÃ© Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.

The inspector kept his word with DantÃ¨s; he examined the register, and
found the following note concerning him:

_Edmond DantÃ¨s:_

Violent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.

The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.

This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it
had been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend
against this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._

This visit had infused new vigor into DantÃ¨s; he had, till then,
forgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the
date, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose
his reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then monthsâ€”DantÃ¨s
still waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This
fortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until
his return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his
circuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months
passed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by
and no favorable change had taken place, and DantÃ¨s began to fancy the
inspectorâ€™s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.

At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had
obtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his
subordinates, and amongst them DantÃ¨sâ€™ jailer. A new governor arrived;
it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;
he learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty
cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,
and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond DantÃ¨sâ€”he was now
number 34.



 Chapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27

DantÃ¨s passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in
suspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious
innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own
innocence, which justified in some measure the governorâ€™s belief in his
mental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he
addressed his supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the
last resource. Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have
any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of
deliverance.

DantÃ¨s asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even
if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous,
was still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated
to be allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing
materials. His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the
same. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the
latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to
speak to a man, even though mute, was something. DantÃ¨s spoke for the
sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but
the sound of his voice terrified him.

Often, before his captivity, DantÃ¨sâ€™ mind had revolted at the idea of
assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers.
He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face
besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the
infamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The
galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other.
They were very happy.

He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it
even the mad abbÃ©. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the
constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of
his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man
who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the
governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that DantÃ¨s wished to
conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. DantÃ¨s had
exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God.

All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he
recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new
meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley
of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first
understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the
pity of heaven! He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the
sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid
every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to
accomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty
oftener addressed to man than to God: â€œForgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them that trespass against us.â€ Yet in spite of his earnest
prayers, DantÃ¨s remained a prisoner.

Then gloom settled heavily upon him. DantÃ¨s was a man of great
simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore,
in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history
of the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild
the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the
imagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors
in Martinâ€™s Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past
life was so short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so
doubtful. Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness!
No distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would
have exalted in thus revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle
in a cage. He clung to one ideaâ€”that of his happiness, destroyed,
without apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and
reconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable
Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.

Rage supplanted religious fervor. DantÃ¨s uttered blasphemies that made
his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the
walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly
upon himself, so that the least thing,â€”a grain of sand, a straw, or a
breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the
letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every
line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene, mene,
tekel upharsin_ of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity
of man, and not the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into
the deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most
horrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient,
because after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at
least the boon of unconsciousness.

By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death,
and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must
be invented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the
brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!

Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye;
but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself
struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once
thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all
is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This
state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings
that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a
sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the
bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.

Edmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his
sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell
when the angel of death seemed about to enter. DantÃ¨s reviewed his past
life with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future
existence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.

â€œSometimes,â€ said he, â€œin my voyages, when I was a man and commanded
other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the
storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with
its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled
and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight
of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then
terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a
sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was
happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed
of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a
creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the
gulls and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound
me to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own
manner, I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I
have paced three thousand times round my cell,â€”that is thirty thousand
steps, or about ten leagues.â€

No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more
composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and
slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt
that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two
methods of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself
with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of
starvation. But the first was repugnant to him. DantÃ¨s had always
entertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the
yard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death. He
resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his
resolve.

0185m



Nearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had
ceased to mark the lapse of time. DantÃ¨s said, â€œI wish to die,â€ and had
chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he
had taken an oath to die. â€œWhen my morning and evening meals are
brought,â€ thought he, â€œI will cast them out of the window, and they
will think that I have eaten them.â€

He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture,
the provisions his jailer brought himâ€”at first gayly, then with
deliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection of
his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once
repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at
a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted
fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life
contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less
sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still youngâ€”he was only
four or five-and-twentyâ€”he had nearly fifty years to live. What
unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to
liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary
Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would
not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient
strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next
morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously
ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.

Thus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over
him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain
at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his
eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the
will-oâ€™-the-wisps that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of
that mysterious country called Death!

Suddenly, about nine oâ€™clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow
sound in the wall against which he was lying.

So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did
not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his
faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond
raised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made
by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the
stones.

Although weakened, the young manâ€™s brain instantly responded to the
idea that haunts all prisonersâ€”liberty! It seemed to him that heaven
had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on
the very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had
so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the
distance that separated them.

No, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams
that forerun death!

Edmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then
heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.

Some hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond
was intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.

For a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that
he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the
attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter
with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously
at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it,
and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last
moments.

The jailer brought him his breakfast. DantÃ¨s raised himself up and
began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food,
about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order
to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his
jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread
for his prisoner.

Fortunately, he fancied that DantÃ¨s was delirious; and placing the food
on the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound
became more and more distinct.

â€œThere can be no doubt about it,â€ thought he; â€œit is some prisoner who
is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help
him!â€

Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to
misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hopeâ€”the idea that the
noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the
neighboring dungeon.

It was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It
was easy to call his jailerâ€™s attention to the noise, and watch his
countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy
hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own
curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmondâ€™s brain was still so feeble that he
could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one
means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned
his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered
towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents
with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.

He had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that
shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much
food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour,
and returned to his couchâ€”he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his
ideas became again collectedâ€”he could think, and strengthen his
thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself:

â€œI must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it
is a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to
work, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as
his occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it.
If, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him,
he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.â€

Edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his
sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone,
and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck
thrice.

At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.

Edmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no
sound was heard from the wallâ€”all was silent there.

Full of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and,
thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh
recovered.

The day passed away in utter silenceâ€”night came without recurrence of
the noise.

â€œIt is a prisoner,â€ said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and
life and energy returned.

The night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.

In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionsâ€”he had already
devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously
for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars
of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise,
and so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he
listened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient
at the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been
disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself.

Three days passedâ€”seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off
by minutes!

At length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time
that night, DantÃ¨s, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall,
fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He
moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and
then went back and listened.

The matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other
side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had
substituted a lever for a chisel.

Encouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the
indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around
for anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist
cement, and displace a stone.

He saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating
was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All
his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.
The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it
would have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and
chair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had
been removed.

0189m



DantÃ¨s had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one
of the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the
floor, and it broke in pieces.

DantÃ¨s concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,
leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural
an accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in,
but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was
working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited
for day.

All night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his
way. Day came, the jailer entered. DantÃ¨s told him that the jug had
fallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went
grumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to
remove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised
the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.

DantÃ¨s heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the
sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by
the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored
uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of
removing the plaster that surrounded it.

The damp had rendered it friable, and DantÃ¨s was able to break it
offâ€”in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had
scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in
two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage
twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.

The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours
he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six
years that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?

This idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with
the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the
stone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give
strength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals
imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must
remove from its socket.

DantÃ¨s strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The
fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, DantÃ¨s
paused with anguish on his brow.

Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive
until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea
occurred to himâ€”he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.

The jailer always brought DantÃ¨sâ€™ soup in an iron saucepan; this
saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for DantÃ¨s had noticed that
it was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave
it to him or to his companion first.

The handle of this saucepan was of iron; DantÃ¨s would have given ten
years of his life in exchange for it.

0191m



The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into
DantÃ¨sâ€™ plate, and DantÃ¨s, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon,
washed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening
came DantÃ¨s put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as
he entered, stepped on it and broke it.

This time he could not blame DantÃ¨s. He was wrong to leave it there,
but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer,
therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour
the soup into; DantÃ¨sâ€™ entire dinner service consisted of one
plateâ€”there was no alternative.

â€œLeave the saucepan,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œyou can take it away when you bring
me my breakfast.â€

This advice was to the jailerâ€™s taste, as it spared him the necessity
of making another trip. He left the saucepan.

DantÃ¨s was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and
after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and
return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted
the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and
employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed DantÃ¨s that all
went well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the
wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.

DantÃ¨s carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of
his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use
of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work
without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his
bed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece
of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.

â€œWell, donâ€™t you intend to bring me another plate?â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œNo,â€ replied the turnkey; â€œyou destroy everything. First you break
your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners
followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave
you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I
hope you will not be so destructive.â€

DantÃ¨s raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the
coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of
iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that
the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was
a greater reason for proceedingâ€”if his neighbor would not come to him,
he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by
the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and
fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailerâ€™s visit arrived,
DantÃ¨s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and
placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of
soup into it, together with the fishâ€”for thrice a week the prisoners
were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time,
had not DantÃ¨s long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the
turnkey retired.

DantÃ¨s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to
work. He listenedâ€”all was silent, as it had been for the last three
days. DantÃ¨s sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him.
However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but
after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no
impression, but met with a smooth surface; DantÃ¨s touched it, and found
that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole
DantÃ¨s had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it.
The unhappy young man had not thought of this.

â€œOh, my God, my God!â€ murmured he, â€œI have so earnestly prayed to you,
that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my
liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to
existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!â€

0193m



â€œWho talks of God and despair at the same time?â€ said a voice that
seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance,
sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young manâ€™s ears. Edmondâ€™s hair
stood on end, and he rose to his knees.

â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œI hear a human voice.â€ Edmond had not heard anyone
speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to
a prisonerâ€”he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding
strength to restraints of oak and iron.

â€œIn the name of Heaven,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œspeak again, though the sound
of your voice terrifies me. Who are you?â€

â€œWho are you?â€ said the voice.

â€œAn unhappy prisoner,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, who made no hesitation in
answering.

â€œOf what country?â€

â€œA Frenchman.â€

â€œYour name?â€

â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s.â€

â€œYour profession?â€

â€œA sailor.â€

â€œHow long have you been here?â€

â€œSince the 28th of February, 1815.â€

â€œYour crime?â€

â€œI am innocent.â€

â€œBut of what are you accused?â€

â€œOf having conspired to aid the emperorâ€™s return.â€

â€œWhat! For the emperorâ€™s return?â€”the emperor is no longer on the
throne, then?â€

â€œHe abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of
Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all
this?â€

â€œSince 1811.â€

DantÃ¨s shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in
prison.

â€œDo not dig any more,â€ said the voice; â€œonly tell me how high up is
your excavation?â€

â€œOn a level with the floor.â€

â€œHow is it concealed?â€

â€œBehind my bed.â€

â€œHas your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œWhat does your chamber open on?â€

â€œA corridor.â€

â€œAnd the corridor?â€

â€œOn a court.â€

â€œAlas!â€ murmured the voice.

â€œOh, what is the matter?â€ cried DantÃ¨s.

â€œI have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong
angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the
wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.â€

â€œBut then you would be close to the sea?â€

â€œThat is what I hoped.â€

â€œAnd supposing you had succeeded?â€

â€œI should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands
near hereâ€”the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulenâ€”and then I should
have been safe.â€

â€œCould you have swum so far?â€

â€œHeaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.â€

â€œAll?â€

â€œYes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait
until you hear from me.â€

â€œTell me, at least, who you are?â€

â€œI amâ€”I am No. 27.â€

â€œYou mistrust me, then,â€ said DantÃ¨s. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter
laugh resounding from the depths.

â€œOh, I am a Christian,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, guessing instinctively that this
man meant to abandon him. â€œI swear to you by him who died for us that
naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I
conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have
got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against
the wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.â€

â€œHow old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.â€

â€œI do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been
here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested,
the 28th of February, 1815.â€

â€œNot quite twenty-six!â€ murmured the voice; â€œat that age he cannot be a
traitor.â€

â€œOh, no, no,â€ cried DantÃ¨s. â€œI swear to you again, rather than betray
you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!â€

â€œYou have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I
was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures
me. I will not forget you. Wait.â€

â€œHow long?â€

â€œI must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.â€

â€œBut you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me
come to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you
of those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love
somebody?â€

â€œNo, I am alone in the world.â€

â€œThen you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if
you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he
yet lives; I only love him and a young girl called MercÃ©dÃ¨s. My father
has not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves
me still; I shall love you as I loved my father.â€

â€œIt is well,â€ returned the voice; â€œtomorrow.â€

These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his
sincerity; DantÃ¨s rose, dispersed the fragments with the same
precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then
gave himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was,
perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a
companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints
made in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are
gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.

All day DantÃ¨s walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on
his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he
bounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind
that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already;
and then his mind was made upâ€”when the jailer moved his bed and stooped
to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would
be condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when
this miraculous noise recalled him to life.

The jailer came in the evening. DantÃ¨s was on his bed. It seemed to him
that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was
a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, â€œCome, are you
going mad again?â€

DantÃ¨s did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would
betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; DantÃ¨s
hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but
he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed
from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.

â€œIs it you?â€ said he; â€œI am here.â€

â€œIs your jailer gone?â€

â€œYes,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œhe will not return until the evening; so that we
have twelve hours before us.â€

â€œI can work, then?â€ said the voice.

â€œOh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.â€

In a moment that part of the floor on which DantÃ¨s was resting his two
hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he
drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a
hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from
the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to
measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly
the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.

0197m




 Chapter 16. A Learned Italian

Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, DantÃ¨s
almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view
of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled
through the grating.

He was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering
and sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost
buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black)
beard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by
care, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a
man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical
strength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow,
while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could
only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been
fashioned.

The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a
certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it
probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.
He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with
evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and
invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him
with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at
that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where
he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.

â€œLet us first see,â€ said he, â€œwhether it is possible to remove the
traces of my entrance hereâ€”our future tranquillity depends upon our
jailers being entirely ignorant of it.â€

Advancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in
spite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:

â€œYou removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools
to aid you.â€

â€œWhy,â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s, with astonishment, â€œdo you possess any?â€

â€œI made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that
are necessary,â€”a chisel, pincers, and lever.â€

0201m



â€œOh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and
patience.â€

â€œWell, in the first place, here is my chisel.â€

So saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of
beechwood.

â€œAnd with what did you contrive to make that?â€ inquired DantÃ¨s.

â€œWith one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed
me to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about
fifty feet.â€

â€œFifty feet!â€ responded DantÃ¨s, almost terrified.

â€œDo not speak so loud, young manâ€”donâ€™t speak so loud. It frequently
occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside
the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the
prisoners.â€

â€œBut they believe I am shut up alone here.â€

â€œThat makes no difference.â€

â€œAnd you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get
here?â€

â€œI do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from
mine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the
necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion,
instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I
expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it,
and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor
on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is
all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled
with soldiers.â€

â€œThatâ€™s true,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œbut the corridor you speak of only bounds
_one_ side of my cell; there are three othersâ€”do you know anything of
their situation?â€

â€œThis one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten
experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many
years to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governorâ€™s
apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get
into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The
fourth and last side of your cell faces onâ€”faces onâ€”stop a minute, now
where does it face?â€

The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole
by which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which
gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an
opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better
security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all
apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the
possibility of a prisonerâ€™s escape. As the stranger asked the question,
he dragged the table beneath the window.

â€œClimb up,â€ said he to DantÃ¨s.

The young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of
his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out
both hands. The stranger, whom as yet DantÃ¨s knew only by the number of
his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a
person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a
lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of DantÃ¨s, and
from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of
the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to
slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to
command a perfect view from top to bottom.

An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, â€œI thought
so!â€ and sliding from the shoulders of DantÃ¨s as dextrously as he had
ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.

â€œWhat was it that you thought?â€ asked the young man anxiously, in his
turn descending from the table.

The elder prisoner pondered the matter. â€œYes,â€ said he at length, â€œit
is so. This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery,
where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and
night.â€

â€œAre you quite sure of that?â€

â€œCertain. I saw the soldierâ€™s shape and the top of his musket; that
made me draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also see
me.â€

â€œWell?â€ inquired DantÃ¨s.

â€œYou perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your
dungeon?â€

â€œThenâ€”â€”â€ pursued the young man eagerly.

â€œThen,â€ answered the elder prisoner, â€œthe will of God be done!â€ And as
the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound
resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance. DantÃ¨s gazed
on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and
ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.

â€œTell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?â€ said he at length.
â€œNever have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.â€

â€œWillingly,â€ answered the stranger; â€œif, indeed, you feel any curiosity
respecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.â€

â€œSay not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own
powerful mind. Pray let me know who you really are?â€

The stranger smiled a melancholy smile. â€œThen listen,â€ said he. â€œI am
the AbbÃ© Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this ChÃ¢teau
dâ€™If since the year 1811; previously to which I had been confined for
three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In the year 1811 I was
transferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I learned that
the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon,
had bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his cradle. I was
very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of;
namely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be
overthrown. Then who reigns in France at this momentâ€”Napoleon II.?â€

â€œNo, Louis XVIII.â€

â€œThe brother of Louis XVI.! How inscrutable are the ways of
Providenceâ€”for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven
to abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so abased?â€

DantÃ¨sâ€™ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his
own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.

â€œYes, yes,â€ continued he, â€œâ€™Twill be the same as it was in England.
After Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles II., and then James
II., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince of Orange, a
stadtholder who becomes a king. Then new concessions to the people,
then a constitution, then liberty. Ah, my friend!â€ said the abbÃ©,
turning towards DantÃ¨s, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a
prophet, â€œyou are young, you will see all this come to pass.â€

â€œProbably, if ever I get out of prison!â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied Faria, â€œwe are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes,
and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond
these walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.â€

â€œBut wherefore are you here?â€

â€œBecause in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize
in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political
face of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a
quantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical
ruler, I sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and,
lastly, because I fancied I had found my CÃ¦sar Borgia in a crowned
simpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. It was
the plan of Alexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed
now, for they attempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to
complete his work. Italy seems fated to misfortune.â€ And the old man
bowed his head.

DantÃ¨s could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.
Napoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and
spoken with him; but of Clement VII. and Alexander VI. he knew nothing.

â€œAre you not,â€ he asked, â€œthe priest who here in the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If is
generally thought to beâ€”ill?â€

â€œMad, you mean, donâ€™t you?â€

â€œI did not like to say so,â€ answered DantÃ¨s, smiling.

â€œWell, then,â€ resumed Faria with a bitter smile, â€œlet me answer your
question in full, by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of
the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, for many years permitted to amuse the different
visitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all probability,
I should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children, if
such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to
suffering and despair.â€

DantÃ¨s remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he
said:

â€œThen you abandon all hope of escape?â€

â€œI perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to
attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.â€

â€œNay, be not discouraged. Would it not be expecting too much to hope to
succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in
another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?â€

â€œAlas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to
effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning
over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I
possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard
as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove
huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days
have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well
repaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of
this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as
the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I
dug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the
fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so
completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add
another handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also
that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my
undertaking, for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to
make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at
the moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed
from me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew
attempts evidently at variance with the Almightyâ€™s pleasure.â€

DantÃ¨s held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the
thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the
failure of the abbÃ©â€™s plans.

The abbÃ© sank upon Edmondâ€™s bed, while Edmond himself remained
standing. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed,
some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on
them for an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feetâ€”to devote
three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a
precipice overhanging the seaâ€”to plunge into the waves from the height
of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to
pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have
escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils
past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three
miles ere you could reach the shoreâ€”were difficulties so startling and
formidable that DantÃ¨s had never even dreamed of such a scheme,
resigning himself rather to death.

But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a
courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new
courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he
had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only
because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost
incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself
with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done
all this; why, then, was it impossible to DantÃ¨s? Faria had dug his way
through fifty feet, DantÃ¨s would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of
fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as
old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk
from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three
miles to one of the islandsâ€”Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a
hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar
task; should he, who had so often for mere amusementâ€™s sake plunged to
the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to
entertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many
times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than
twice as long! At once DantÃ¨s resolved to follow the brave example of
his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done
may be done again.

After continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man
suddenly exclaimed, â€œI have found what you were in search of!â€

Faria started: â€œHave you, indeed?â€ cried he, raising his head with
quick anxiety; â€œpray, let me know what it is you have discovered?â€

â€œThe corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you
occupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does
it not?â€

0207m



â€œIt does.â€

â€œAnd is not above fifteen feet from it?â€

â€œAbout that.â€

â€œWell, then, I will tell you what we must do. We must pierce through
the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the
top part of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately;
we shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel
who guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is
courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient
in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yoursâ€”you shall now see
me prove mine.â€

â€œOne instant, my dear friend,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œit is clear you do
not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and
what use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider
that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the
task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day.
But then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention),
then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the
Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyâ€”one who had
committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.â€

â€œAnd have your notions changed?â€ asked DantÃ¨s with much surprise; â€œdo
you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have
encountered me?â€

â€œNo; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself
merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no
sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so
easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.â€

A slight movement of surprise escaped DantÃ¨s.

â€œIs it possible,â€ said he, â€œthat where your liberty is at stake you can
allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?â€

â€œTell me,â€ replied Faria, â€œwhat has hindered you from knocking down
your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing
yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?â€

â€œSimply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,â€ answered DantÃ¨s.

â€œBecause,â€ said the old man, â€œthe natural repugnance to the commission
of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is
because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us
from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature
teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell
to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this
instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to
spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of
bloodâ€”it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a
shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and
physiological formationâ€”â€”â€

DantÃ¨s was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts
which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for
there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head
and those that emanate from the heart.

0209m



â€œSince my imprisonment,â€ said Faria, â€œI have thought over all the most
celebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely been successful.
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated
upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the
Duc de Beaufort from the ChÃ¢teau de Vincennes, that of the AbbÃ©
Dubuquoi from For lâ€™EvÃªque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are
those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the
best of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable
moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.â€

â€œAh,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œyou might well endure the tedious delay; you were
constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with
toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.â€

â€œI assure you,â€ replied the old man, â€œI did not turn to that source for
recreation or support.â€

â€œWhat did you do then?â€

â€œI wrote or studied.â€

â€œWere you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ answered the abbÃ©; â€œI had none but what I made for myself.â€

â€œYou made paper, pens and ink?â€

â€œYes.â€

DantÃ¨s gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.
Faria saw this.

â€œWhen you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,â€ said he, â€œI will
show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of
my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the
Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Markâ€™s column at Venice, and on
the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that
they would be arranged in order within the walls of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If.
The work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a
General Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.â€

â€œAnd on what have you written all this?â€

â€œOn two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as
smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.â€

â€œYou are, then, a chemist?â€

â€œSomewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.â€

â€œBut for such a work you must have needed booksâ€”had you any?â€

â€œI had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after
reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and
fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of
all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I
devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one
hundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that
since I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled
me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open
before me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,
Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,
Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most
important.â€

â€œYou are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to
have been able to read all these?â€

â€œYes, I speak five of the modern tonguesâ€”that is to say, German,
French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I
learned modern Greekâ€”I donâ€™t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am
still trying to improve myself.â€

â€œImprove yourself!â€ repeated DantÃ¨s; â€œwhy, how can you manage to do
so?â€

â€œWhy, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and
arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their
medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is
absolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred
thousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I
certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;
and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.â€

Stronger grew the wonder of DantÃ¨s, who almost fancied he had to do
with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some
imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,
he added, â€œThen if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage
to write the work you speak of?â€

â€œI made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally
preferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings
are served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of
the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight
with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for
I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest
solace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and
traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am
myself a prisoner.â€

â€œBut the ink,â€ said DantÃ¨s; â€œof what did you make your ink?â€

â€œThere was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,â€ replied Faria, â€œbut it
was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it
must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a
coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought
to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired.
For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I
pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.â€

â€œAnd when,â€ asked DantÃ¨s, â€œmay I see all this?â€

â€œWhenever you please,â€ replied the abbÃ©.

â€œOh, then let it be directly!â€ exclaimed the young man.

â€œFollow me, then,â€ said the abbÃ©, as he re-entered the subterranean
passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by DantÃ¨s.



 Chapter 17. The AbbÃ©â€™s Chamber

After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean
passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves
erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into
which the abbÃ©â€™s cell opened; from that point the passage became much
narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.
The floor of the abbÃ©â€™s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one
of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to
commence the laborious task of which DantÃ¨s had witnessed the
completion.

As he entered the chamber of his friend, DantÃ¨s cast around one eager
and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more
than common met his view.

â€œIt is well,â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œwe have some hours before usâ€”it is now
just a quarter past twelve oâ€™clock.â€ Instinctively DantÃ¨s turned round
to observe by what watch or clock the abbÃ© had been able so accurately
to specify the hour.

â€œLook at this ray of light which enters by my window,â€ said the abbÃ©,
â€œand then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these
lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and
the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the
precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that
might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth
never vary in their appointed paths.â€

This last explanation was wholly lost upon DantÃ¨s, who had always
imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in
the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement
of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared
to him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companionâ€™s
lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging
out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda,
which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in
his earliest youth.

â€œCome,â€ said he to the abbÃ©, â€œI am anxious to see your treasures.â€

The abbÃ© smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by
the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the
hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a
safe depository of the articles mentioned to DantÃ¨s.

0213m



â€œWhat do you wish to see first?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œOh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!â€

Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of
linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls
consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long;
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so
legible that DantÃ¨s could easily read it, as well as make out the
senseâ€”it being in Italian, a language he, as a ProvenÃ§al, perfectly
understood.

â€œThere,â€ said he, â€œthere is the work complete. I wrote the word _finis_
at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up
two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to
complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find
in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have
composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.â€

â€œI see,â€ answered DantÃ¨s. â€œNow let me behold the curious pens with
which you have written your work.â€

â€œLook!â€ said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six
inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine
painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one
of those cartilages of which the abbÃ© had before spoken to DantÃ¨s; it
was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. DantÃ¨s
examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the
instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.

â€œAh, yes,â€ said Faria; â€œthe penknife. Thatâ€™s my masterpiece. I made it,
as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.â€ The
penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it
would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.

DantÃ¨s examined the various articles shown to him with the same
attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools
exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the
South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading
vessels.

â€œAs for the ink,â€ said Faria, â€œI told you how I managed to obtain
thatâ€”and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.â€

â€œOne thing still puzzles me,â€ observed DantÃ¨s, â€œand that is how you
managed to do all this by daylight?â€

â€œI worked at night also,â€ replied Faria.

â€œNight!â€”why, for Heavenâ€™s sake, are your eyes like catsâ€™, that you can
see to work in the dark?â€

â€œIndeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence
that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I
furnished myself with a light.â€

â€œYou did? Pray tell me how.â€

â€œI separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made
oilâ€”here is my lamp.â€ So saying, the abbÃ© exhibited a sort of torch
very similar to those used in public illuminations.

â€œBut how do you procure a light?â€

â€œOh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.â€

â€œAnd matches?â€

â€œI pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little
sulphur, which was readily supplied.â€

DantÃ¨s laid the different things he had been looking at on the table,
and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed
by the perseverance and strength of Fariaâ€™s mind.

0215m



â€œYou have not seen all yet,â€ continued Faria, â€œfor I did not think it
wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut
this one up.â€ They put the stone back in its place; the abbÃ© sprinkled
a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed,
rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the
other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it
stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting
in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this
space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
DantÃ¨s closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and
compact enough to bear any weight.

â€œWho supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?â€

â€œI tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets
of my bed, during my three yearsâ€™ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when
I was removed to the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, I managed to bring the ravellings
with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.â€

â€œAnd was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?â€

â€œOh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the
edges over again.â€

â€œWith what?â€

â€œWith this needle,â€ said the abbÃ©, as, opening his ragged vestments, he
showed DantÃ¨s a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for
the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.

â€œI once thought,â€ continued Faria, â€œof removing these iron bars, and
letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat
wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more
preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely
have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the
project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I
carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen
opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance
frequently brings about.â€

While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind
of DantÃ¨s was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so
intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbÃ© might probably be
able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself
could see nothing.

â€œWhat are you thinking of?â€ asked the abbÃ© smilingly, imputing the deep
abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe
and wonder.

â€œI was reflecting, in the first place,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œupon the
enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to
reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you
not have accomplished if you had been free?â€

â€œPossibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a
state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is
needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my
mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the
collision of clouds electricity is producedâ€”from electricity,
lightning, from lightning, illumination.â€

â€œNo,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. â€œI know nothing. Some of your words are to me
quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the
knowledge you have.â€

The abbÃ© smiled. â€œWell,â€ said he, â€œbut you had another subject for your
thoughts; did you not say so just now?â€

â€œI did!â€

â€œYou have told me as yet but one of themâ€”let me hear the other.â€

â€œIt was this,â€”that while you had related to me all the particulars of
your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.â€

â€œYour life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit
of your having passed through any very important events.â€

â€œIt has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved
misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no
longer vent reproaches upon Heaven.â€

â€œThen you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?â€

â€œI do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon
earth,â€”my father and MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œCome,â€ said the abbÃ©, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed
back to its original situation, â€œlet me hear your story.â€

DantÃ¨s obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three
voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last
cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet
to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with
that personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a
letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtierâ€”his arrival at Marseilles, and
interview with his fatherâ€”his affection for MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and their nuptual
feastâ€”his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at
the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If.
From this point everything was a blank to DantÃ¨sâ€”he knew nothing more,
not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital
finished, the abbÃ© reflected long and earnestly.

â€œThere is,â€ said he, at the end of his meditations, â€œa clever maxim,
which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and
that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved
mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.
Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices,
and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle
within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and
wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you
visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover
the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any
way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,â€”to whom could your
disappearance have been serviceable?â€

â€œTo no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.â€

â€œDo not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor
philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king
who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his
rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the kingâ€™s death, his
successor inherits a crown,â€”when the employee dies, the supernumerary
steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand
livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are
as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from
the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder,
and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in
Descartesâ€™ theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase
as we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason
rests upon the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your
particular world. You say you were on the point of being made captain
of the _Pharaon_?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œNow, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the
accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the
question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from
being captain of the _Pharaon_. What say you?â€

â€œI cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board,
and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain
themselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me.
There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of
ill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and
had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.â€

â€œNow we are getting on. And what was this manâ€™s name?â€

â€œDanglars.â€

â€œWhat rank did he hold on board?â€

â€œHe was supercargo.â€

â€œAnd had you been captain, should you have retained him in his
employment?â€

â€œNot if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed
inaccuracies in his accounts.â€

â€œGood again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last
conversation with Captain Leclere?â€

â€œNo; we were quite alone.â€

â€œCould your conversation have been overheard by anyone?â€

â€œIt might, for the cabin door was openâ€”andâ€”stay; now I
recollect,â€”Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was
giving me the packet for the grand marshal.â€

â€œThatâ€™s better,â€ cried the abbÃ©; â€œnow we are on the right scent. Did
you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?â€

â€œNobody.â€

â€œSomebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of
it, I think?â€

â€œYes; the grand marshal did.â€

â€œAnd what did you do with that letter?â€

â€œPut it into my portfolio.â€

â€œYou had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find
room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official
letter?â€

â€œYou are right; it was left on board.â€

â€œThen it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter
in the portfolio?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œAnd what did you do with this same letter while returning from
Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?â€

â€œI carried it in my hand.â€

â€œSo that when you went on board the _Pharaon_, everybody could see that
you held a letter in your hand?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œDanglars, as well as the rest?â€

â€œDanglars, as well as others.â€

â€œNow, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your
arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you
was formulated?â€

â€œOh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my
memory.â€

â€œRepeat it to me.â€

DantÃ¨s paused a moment, then said, â€œThis is it, word for word: â€˜The
kingâ€™s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion,
that one Edmond DantÃ¨s, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived
from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been
intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the
usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of
his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will
be found either about his person, at his fatherâ€™s residence, or in his
cabin on board the _Pharaon_.â€™â€

The abbÃ© shrugged his shoulders. â€œThe thing is clear as day,â€ said he;
â€œand you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good
heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.â€

â€œDo you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.â€

â€œHow did Danglars usually write?â€

â€œIn a handsome, running hand.â€

â€œAnd how was the anonymous letter written?â€

â€œBackhanded.â€

Again the abbÃ© smiled. â€œDisguised.â€

â€œIt was very boldly written, if disguised.â€

â€œStop a bit,â€ said the abbÃ©, taking up what he called his pen, and,
after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,
with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.
DantÃ¨s drew back, and gazed on the abbÃ© with a sensation almost
amounting to terror.

â€œHow very astonishing!â€ cried he at length. â€œWhy your writing exactly
resembles that of the accusation.â€

â€œSimply because that accusation had been written with the left hand;
and I have noticed thatâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œThat while the writing of different persons done with the right hand
varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.â€

â€œYou have evidently seen and observed everything.â€

â€œLet us proceed.â€

â€œOh, yes, yes!â€

â€œNow as regards the second question.â€

â€œI am listening.â€

â€œWas there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage
with MercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€

â€œYes; a young man who loved her.â€

â€œAnd his name wasâ€”â€”â€

â€œFernand.â€

â€œThat is a Spanish name, I think?â€

â€œHe was a Catalan.â€

â€œYou imagine him capable of writing the letter?â€

â€œOh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife
into me.â€

â€œThat is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an
assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,
never.â€

â€œBesides,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œthe various circumstances mentioned in the
letter were wholly unknown to him.â€

â€œYou had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?â€

â€œTo no one.â€

â€œNot even to your mistress?â€

â€œNo, not even to my betrothed.â€

â€œThen it is Danglars.â€

â€œI feel quite sure of it now.â€

â€œWait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?â€

â€œNoâ€”yes, he was. Now I recollectâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œTo have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at
PÃ¨re Pamphileâ€™s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They
were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way,
but Fernand looked pale and agitated.â€

â€œWere they alone?â€

â€œThere was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who
had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!â€”stay!â€”How strange that it
should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that
on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s, pressing
his hand to his throbbing brows.

â€œIs there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the
villany of your friends?â€ inquired the abbÃ© with a laugh.

â€œYes, yes,â€ replied DantÃ¨s eagerly; â€œI would beg of you, who see so
completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery
seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent
no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was
condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?â€

â€œThat is altogether a different and more serious matter,â€ responded the
abbÃ©. â€œThe ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be
easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been
childâ€™s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of
the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on
every point.â€

â€œPray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see
more clearly into my life than I do myself.â€

â€œIn the first place, then, who examined you,â€”the kingâ€™s attorney, his
deputy, or a magistrate?â€

â€œThe deputy.â€

â€œWas he young or old?â€

â€œAbout six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.â€

â€œSo,â€ answered the abbÃ©. â€œOld enough to be ambitious, but too young to
be corrupt. And how did he treat you?â€

â€œWith more of mildness than severity.â€

â€œDid you tell him your whole story?â€

â€œI did.â€

â€œAnd did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?â€

â€œHe did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought
me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.â€

â€œBy your misfortune?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThen you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?â€

â€œHe gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.â€

â€œAnd that?â€

â€œHe burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.â€

â€œWhat? the accusation?â€

â€œNo; the letter.â€

â€œAre you sure?â€

â€œI saw it done.â€

â€œThat alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater
scoundrel than you have thought possible.â€

â€œUpon my word,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œyou make me shudder. Is the world filled
with tigers and crocodiles?â€

â€œYes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
dangerous than the others.â€

â€œNever mind; let us go on.â€

â€œWith all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?â€

â€œHe did; saying at the same time, â€˜You see I thus destroy the only
proof existing against you.â€™â€

â€œThis action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.â€

â€œYou think so?â€

â€œI am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?â€

â€œTo M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-HÃ©ron, No. 13, Paris.â€

â€œNow can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?â€

â€œWhy, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me
promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring
me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he
insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned
in the address.â€

â€œNoirtier!â€ repeated the abbÃ©; â€œNoirtier!â€”I knew a person of that name
at the court of the Queen of Etruria,â€”a Noirtier, who had been a
Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?â€

â€œDe Villefort!â€ The abbÃ© burst into a fit of laughter, while DantÃ¨s
gazed on him in utter astonishment.

â€œWhat ails you?â€ said he at length.

â€œDo you see that ray of sunlight?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œWell, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.
Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed
great sympathy and commiseration for you?â€

â€œHe did.â€

â€œAnd the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhy, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this
Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This
Noirtier was his father!â€

Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of DantÃ¨s, or hell opened its
yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely
transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected
words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to
prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, â€œHis father! his
father!â€

â€œYes, his father,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œhis right name was Noirtier de
Villefort.â€

At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of DantÃ¨s, and
cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that
had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the
letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the
magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce
punishment,â€”all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried
out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried
to the opening that led from the abbÃ©â€™s cell to his own, and said, â€œI
must be alone, to think over all this.â€

When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the
turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and
contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these
hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he
had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by
a solemn oath.

DantÃ¨s was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria,
who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his
fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his
mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the
abbÃ© unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter
quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a
small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbÃ© had come to
ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.

DantÃ¨s followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now
wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance
that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria
bent on him his penetrating eye.

â€œI regret now,â€ said he, â€œhaving helped you in your late inquiries, or
having given you the information I did.â€

â€œWhy so?â€ inquired DantÃ¨s.

â€œBecause it has instilled a new passion in your heartâ€”that of
vengeance.â€

DantÃ¨s smiled. â€œLet us talk of something else,â€ said he.

Again the abbÃ© looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in
accordance with DantÃ¨sâ€™ request, he began to speak of other matters.
The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like
that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and
important hints as well as sound information; but it was never
egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
DantÃ¨s listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his
remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort
of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of
the good abbÃ©â€™s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him;
but, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes,
opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave
fantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the
delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly
gifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at
home.

â€œYou must teach me a small part of what you know,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œif
only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so
learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being
tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself.
If you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention
another word about escaping.â€

The abbÃ© smiled.

â€œAlas, my boy,â€ said he, â€œhuman knowledge is confined within very
narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics,
history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am
acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely
require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I
possess.â€

â€œTwo years!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s; â€œdo you really believe I can acquire all
these things in so short a time?â€

â€œNot their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to
learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory
makes the one, philosophy the other.â€

â€œBut cannot one learn philosophy?â€

â€œPhilosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to
truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into
heaven.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œWhat shall you teach me first? I am in a
hurry to begin. I want to learn.â€

â€œEverything,â€ said the abbÃ©. And that very evening the prisoners
sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.
DantÃ¨s possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his
mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally
poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality
of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He
already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic
dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two
languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so
that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and
German.

In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbÃ©, DantÃ¨s spoke no
more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no
room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged
his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring
in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by
unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year
DantÃ¨s was a new man. DantÃ¨s observed, however, that Faria, in spite of
the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed
incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall
into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,
and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.
One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:

â€œAh, if there were no sentinel!â€

â€œThere shall not be one a minute longer than you please,â€ said DantÃ¨s,
who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though
his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest
operations.

â€œI have already told you,â€ answered the abbÃ©, â€œthat I loathe the idea
of shedding blood.â€

â€œAnd yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a
measure of self-preservation.â€

â€œNo matter! I could never agree to it.â€

â€œStill, you have thought of it?â€

â€œIncessantly, alas!â€ cried the abbÃ©.

â€œAnd you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you
not?â€ asked DantÃ¨s eagerly.

â€œI have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in
the gallery beyond us.â€

â€œHe shall be both blind and deaf,â€ replied the young man, with an air
of determination that made his companion shudder.

â€œNo, no,â€ cried the abbÃ©; â€œimpossible!â€

DantÃ¨s endeavored to renew the subject; the abbÃ© shook his head in
token of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three
months passed away.

â€œAre you strong?â€ the abbÃ© asked one day of DantÃ¨s. The young man, in
reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and
then as readily straightened it.

â€œAnd will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last
resort?â€

â€œI promise on my honor.â€

â€œThen,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œwe may hope to put our design into execution.â€

â€œAnd how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?â€

â€œAt least a year.â€

â€œAnd shall we begin at once?â€

â€œAt once.â€

â€œWe have lost a year to no purpose!â€ cried DantÃ¨s.

â€œDo you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?â€ asked the
abbÃ©.

â€œForgive me!â€ cried Edmond, blushing deeply.

â€œTut, tut!â€ answered the abbÃ©, â€œman is but man after all, and you are
about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me
show you my plan.â€

The abbÃ© then showed DantÃ¨s the sketch he had made for their escape. It
consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of DantÃ¨s, with the
passage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level
as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners
immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once
there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones
with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the
desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who,
stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by DantÃ¨s
before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to
make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let
themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbÃ©â€™s ladder of
cords.

DantÃ¨sâ€™ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at
the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.
That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity
proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of
ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except
the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in
anticipation of the turnkeyâ€™s visits. They had learned to distinguish
the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards
their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his
coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which
would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees
and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Fariaâ€™s or
DantÃ¨sâ€™ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the
night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to
remain.

More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools
for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still
continuing to instruct DantÃ¨s by conversing with him, sometimes in one
language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history
of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and
trodden the path of glory. The abbÃ© was a man of the world, and had,
moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of
melancholy dignity which DantÃ¨s, thanks to the imitative powers
bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward
polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is
seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant
intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.

At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation
completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly
hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over
their heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently
dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final
attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread
now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall
should give way before its right time, and this they had in some
measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they
had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.
DantÃ¨s was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard
Faria, who had remained in Edmondâ€™s cell for the purpose of cutting a
peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of
great suffering. DantÃ¨s hastened to his dungeon, where he found him
standing in the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead
streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched tightly together.

â€œGracious heavens!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s, â€œwhat is the matter? what has
happened?â€

â€œQuick! quick!â€ returned the abbÃ©, â€œlisten to what I have to say.â€

DantÃ¨s looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,
whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,
while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair
seemed to stand on end.

â€œTell me, I beseech you, what ails you?â€ cried DantÃ¨s, letting his
chisel fall to the floor.

â€œAlas,â€ faltered out the abbÃ©, â€œall is over with me. I am seized with a
terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast
approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my
imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you
what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of
the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out
for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there
half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to meâ€”or ratherâ€”no,
no!â€”I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have
the strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how
long the attack may last?â€

In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly
frustrated his hopes, DantÃ¨s did not lose his presence of mind, but
descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with
him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the
abbÃ©â€™s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.

â€œThanks,â€ said the poor abbÃ©, shivering as though his veins were filled
with ice. â€œI am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it
comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though
dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms
may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful
convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries
are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be
removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.
When I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and
not before,â€”be careful about this,â€”force open my teeth with the knife,
pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down
my throat, and I may perhaps revive.â€

â€œPerhaps!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s in grief-stricken tones.

â€œHelp! help!â€ cried the abbÃ©, â€œIâ€”Iâ€”dieâ€”Iâ€”â€”â€

0229m



So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was
unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole
frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one
side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself
about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, DantÃ¨s
prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The
fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder
and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled
under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became
as rigid as a corpse.

Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,
taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed
jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and
anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave
no sign of returning animation. DantÃ¨s began to fear he had delayed too
long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his
hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At
length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned
to the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the
sufferer made a feeble effort to move.

â€œHe is saved! he is saved!â€ cried DantÃ¨s in a paroxysm of delight.

The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident
anxiety towards the door. DantÃ¨s listened, and plainly distinguished
the approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven
oâ€™clock; but Edmondâ€™s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his
head.

The young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully
drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had
scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the
prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key
had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer
had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, DantÃ¨s, whose
restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the
food brought him, hurried back to the abbÃ©â€™s chamber, and raising the
stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick manâ€™s
couch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay
helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.

â€œI did not expect to see you again,â€ said he feebly, to DantÃ¨s.

â€œAnd why not?â€ asked the young man. â€œDid you fancy yourself dying?â€

â€œNo, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I
thought you might have made your escape.â€

The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of DantÃ¨s.

â€œWithout you? Did you really think me capable of that?â€

â€œAt least,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œI now see how wrong such an opinion would
have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this
attack.â€

â€œBe of good cheer,â€ replied DantÃ¨s; â€œyour strength will return.â€ And as
he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his
hands. The abbÃ© shook his head.

â€œThe last attack I had,â€ said he, â€œlasted but half an hour, and after
it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my
right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that
there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will
either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.â€

â€œNo, no,â€ cried DantÃ¨s; â€œyou are mistakenâ€”you will not die! And your
third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at
liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only
with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command
every requisite assistance.â€

â€œMy good Edmond,â€ answered the abbÃ©, â€œbe not deceived. The attack which
has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison.
None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.â€

â€œWell, we will wait,â€”a week, a month, two months, if need be,â€”and
meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our
flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able
to swim we will go.â€

â€œI shall never swim again,â€ replied Faria. â€œThis arm is paralyzed; not
for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.â€

The young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight,
perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.

â€œYou are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?â€ asked the abbÃ©. â€œDepend
upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of
this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it,
for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of
it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I
have twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated
Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.â€

0233m



â€œThe physician may be mistaken!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s. â€œAnd as for your
poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my
shoulders, and swim for both of us.â€

â€œMy son,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œyou, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must
know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done
fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain
hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I
shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all
human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are
young and active, delay not on my account, but flyâ€”goâ€”I give you back
your promise.â€

â€œIt is well,â€ said DantÃ¨s. â€œThen I shall also remain.â€ Then, rising and
extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old manâ€™s head, he
slowly added, â€œBy the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while
you live.â€

Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.

â€œThanks,â€ murmured the invalid, extending one hand. â€œI accept. You may
one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But
as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to
fill up the excavation beneath the soldierâ€™s gallery; he might, by
chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention
of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery
which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set
about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;
keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow
till after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the
greatest importance to communicate to you.â€

DantÃ¨s took the hand of the abbÃ© in his, and affectionately pressed it.
Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his
task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show
towards his aged friend.



 Chapter 18. The Treasure

When DantÃ¨s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in
captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of
light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in
his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the
use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small
compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He
did not speak, but showed the paper to DantÃ¨s.

â€œWhat is that?â€ he inquired.

â€œLook at it,â€ said the abbÃ© with a smile.

â€œI have looked at it with all possible attention,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œand I
only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters
inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.â€

â€œThis paper, my friend,â€ said Faria, â€œI may now avow to you, since I
have the proof of your fidelityâ€”this paper is my treasure, of which,
from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.â€

The sweat started forth on DantÃ¨sâ€™ brow. Until this day and for how
long a time!â€”he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had
brought upon the abbÃ© the accusation of madness. With his instinctive
delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,
and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old
man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria,
after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into
mental alienation.

â€œYour treasure?â€ stammered DantÃ¨s. Faria smiled.

â€œYes,â€ said he. â€œYou have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by
your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this
moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, DantÃ¨s, and
if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yesâ€”you. No one
would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,
who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards
if you will.â€

â€œAlas,â€ murmured Edmond to himself, â€œthis is a terrible relapse! There
was only this blow wanting.â€ Then he said aloud, â€œMy dear friend, your
attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?
Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to
nurse you carefully. Besides,â€ he said, â€œa treasure is not a thing we
need hurry about.â€

â€œOn the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!â€
replied the old man. â€œWho knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the
third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,
indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which
would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to
those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I
tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my
captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now
that I see you, young and with a promising future,â€”now that I think of
all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I
shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as
worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden
wealth.â€

Edmond turned away his head with a sigh.

â€œYou persist in your incredulity, Edmond,â€ continued Faria. â€œMy words
have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this
paper, which I have never shown to anyone.â€

â€œTomorrow, my dear friend,â€ said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to
the old manâ€™s madness. â€œI thought it was understood that we should not
talk of that until tomorrow.â€

â€œThen we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper
today.â€

â€œI will not irritate him,â€ thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of
which half was wanting,â€”having been burnt, no doubt, by some
accident,â€”he read:

â€œthis treasure, which may amount to two...

of Roman crowns in the most distant a...

of the second opening wh...

declare to belong to him alo...

heir.

                    â€œ25th April, 149â€™â€


â€œWell!â€ said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.

â€œWhy,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œI see nothing but broken lines and unconnected
words, which are rendered illegible by fire.â€

â€œYes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for
me, who have grown pale over them by many nightsâ€™ study, and have
reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.â€

â€œAnd do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?â€

â€œI am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen
to the history of this paper.â€

â€œSilence!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s. â€œSteps approachâ€”I goâ€”adieu!â€

And DantÃ¨s, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be
sure to confirm his belief in his friendâ€™s mental instability, glided
like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his
alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with
his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to
avoid discovery.

It was the governor, who, hearing of Fariaâ€™s illness from the jailer,
had come in person to see him.

Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he
might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half
stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with
pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus
separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the
case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for
whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a
slight indisposition.

During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,
tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first
acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so
wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so
much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria
deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?

DantÃ¨s remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his
friend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,
once for all, that the abbÃ© was madâ€”such a conviction would be so
terrible!

But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had
gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get
over the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard
the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his
leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was
obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to
enter by the small aperture which led to DantÃ¨sâ€™ chamber.

â€œHere I am, pursuing you remorselessly,â€ he said with a benignant
smile. â€œYou thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen
to me.â€

Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he
seated himself on the stool beside him.

â€œYou know,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œthat I was the secretary and intimate
friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe
to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,
although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I
heard the phrase very often, â€˜As rich as a Spada.â€™ But he, like public
rumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.
I was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the
world, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all
he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The
cardinalâ€™s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble
patron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty
family manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his
unavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that
followed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume
relating to the History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth
chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI., were the following lines,
which I can never forget:â€”

â€œâ€˜The great wars of Romagna had ended; CÃ¦sar Borgia, who had completed
his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had
also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of
France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and
it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable
scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished
condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined
to make two cardinals.â€™

â€œBy choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich
menâ€”_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first
place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which
the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell
besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.

â€œThe pope and CÃ¦sar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they
were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of
the Holy See, and CÃ¦sar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the
Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.
They were ambitious, and CÃ¦sar Borgia soon found purchasers for their
appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being
cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals
held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns
entered into the coffers of the speculators.

0239m



â€œIt is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The
pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them
the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their
affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and CÃ¦sar
Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of
dispute between the Holy Father and his son. CÃ¦sar thought they could
make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends,
that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to
certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated
cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,â€”a negligence
on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the
opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person
was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the
ring with the lionâ€™s head, which CÃ¦sar wore when he wanted to greet his
friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored,
and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.

â€œCÃ¦sar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the
cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander
VI. replied: â€˜Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi,
let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get
that money back. Besides, you forget, CÃ¦sar, an indigestion declares
itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day
or two.â€™ CÃ¦sar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals
were consequently invited to dinner.

â€œThe table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San
Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by
report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a
good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,
and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest
promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to
his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the
servant did not find him.

â€œSpada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so
eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a
centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, â€˜CÃ¦sar wills that
you die.â€™ but it was a legate _Ã  latere_, who came with a smile on his
lips to say from the pope, â€˜His holiness requests you to dine with
him.â€™

â€œSpada set out about two oâ€™clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited
him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his
nephew, in full costume, and CÃ¦sar Borgia paying him most marked
attentions. Spada turned pale, as CÃ¦sar looked at him with an ironical
air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was
well spread.

â€œThey began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if
he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly
comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had
already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by
the popeâ€™s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach
him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician
declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died
on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door,
making signs which his wife could not comprehend.

â€œThen CÃ¦sar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under
pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance
consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:â€”â€˜I
bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst
others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve
in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.â€™

â€œThe heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the
furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was
really the most miserable of unclesâ€”no treasuresâ€”unless they were those
of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all.
CÃ¦sar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found
nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns
in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to
say to his wife before he expired: â€˜Look well among my uncleâ€™s papers;
there is a will.â€™

â€œThey sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but
it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the
Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value,
and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they
were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years
rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,â€”you know by what mistake.
CÃ¦sar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a
snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a
tigerâ€™s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself
obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.

â€œAfter the popeâ€™s death and his sonâ€™s exile, it was supposed that the
Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before
the cardinalâ€™s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in
doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public
rumor was, that CÃ¦sar, a better politician than his father, had carried
off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two,
because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was
completely despoiled.

â€œUp to this point,â€ said Faria, interrupting the thread of his
narrative, â€œthis seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?â€

â€œOh, my friend,â€ cried DantÃ¨s, â€œon the contrary, it seems as if I were
reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.â€

â€œI will. The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years
rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others
diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some
were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I
wasâ€”the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the
disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest
all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The
celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the countâ€™s
possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the
singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to
be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with
superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful
Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always
carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.

â€œAt the sight of papers of all sorts,â€”titles, contracts, parchments,
which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the
poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of
documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but
in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I foundâ€”nothing. Yet I had
read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for
the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had
occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal CÃ¦sar Spada; but could
only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi,
his companion in misfortune.

â€œI was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited
the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the
treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth
under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated
a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the
family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my
ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.

â€œMy patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers,
his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous
breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns,
which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary
masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a
genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did
scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.

â€œIn 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the
death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see
presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for
the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was
sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at
Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed,
my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor
at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head
dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three oâ€™clock in the
afternoon.

0243m



â€œI awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in
utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined
to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple
manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took
a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece
of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a
light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing,
however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a
moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which
was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and
which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request
of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and
putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.

â€œBut beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire
ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it
in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper
in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible
emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had
been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when
exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by
the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again,
DantÃ¨s, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and
unconnected sense.â€

Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to DantÃ¨s, who this
time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color
resembling rust:

     â€œThis 25th day of April, 1498, be...

     Alexander VI., and fearing that not...

     he may desire to become my heir, and re...

     and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...

     my sole heir, that I have bu...

     and has visited with me, that is, in...

     Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...

     jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...

     may amount to nearly two mil...

     will find on raising the twentieth ro...

     creek to the east in a right line. Two open...

     in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...

     which treasure I bequeath and leave en...

     as my sole heir.

     â€œ25th April, 1498.

     â€œCÃ¦s...


â€œAnd now,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œread this other paper;â€ and he presented to
DantÃ¨s a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which
Edmond read as follows:

           â€œ...ing invited to dine by his Holiness

        ...content with making me pay for my hat,

   ...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara

           ...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada

                      ...ried in a place he knows

                        ...the caves of the small

                 ...essed of ingots, gold, money,

 ...know of the existence of this treasure, which

                                    ...ar â€  Spada.â€


Faria followed him with an excited look.

â€œAnd now,â€ he said, when he saw that DantÃ¨s had read the last line,
â€œput the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.â€ DantÃ¨s
obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:

0245m



â€œThis 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness
Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my
hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate
of Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...I declare to
my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place
he knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small
Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...essed of ingots, gold, money,
jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this
treasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns,
and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small
creek to the east in a right line. Two open...ings have been made in
these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...ngle in the second;
which treasure I bequeath and leave en...tire to him as my sole heir.
â€œ25th April, 1498. â€œCÃ¦s...ar â€  Spada.â€

â€œWell, do you comprehend now?â€ inquired Faria.

â€œIt is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought
for,â€ replied Edmond, still incredulous.

â€œYes; a thousand times, yes!â€

â€œAnd who completed it as it now is?â€

â€œI did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring
the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden
meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a
cavern by the small ray of light above us.â€

â€œAnd what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?â€

â€œI resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying
with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian
kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,
quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to
him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my
hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having
aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was
leaving Piombino.

â€œNow,â€ continued Faria, addressing DantÃ¨s with an almost paternal
expression, â€œnow, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If
we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here,
and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.â€

â€œBut,â€ inquired DantÃ¨s hesitating, â€œhas this treasure no more
legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?â€

â€œNo, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count
of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic
breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind
satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy
it without remorse.â€

â€œAnd you say this treasure amounts toâ€”â€”â€

â€œTwo millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.â€2

â€œImpossible!â€ said DantÃ¨s, staggered at the enormous amount.

â€œImpossible? and why?â€ asked the old man. â€œThe Spada family was one of
the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in
those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such
accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at
this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly
a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they
cannot touch.â€

Edmond thought he was in a dreamâ€”he wavered between incredulity and
joy.

â€œI have only kept this secret so long from you,â€ continued Faria, â€œthat
I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped
before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte
Cristo; now,â€ he added, with a sigh, â€œit is you who will conduct me
thither. Well, DantÃ¨s, you do not thank me?â€

â€œThis treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, â€œand to
you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.â€

â€œYou are my son, DantÃ¨s,â€ exclaimed the old man. â€œYou are the child of
my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you
to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a
father, and the prisoner who could not get free.â€

And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to
the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.



 Chapter 19. The Third Attack

Now that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbÃ©â€™s
meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really
loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he
expatiated on the amount, explaining to DantÃ¨s all the good which, with
thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days
to his friends; and then DantÃ¨sâ€™ countenance became gloomy, for the
oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected
how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions
could do to his enemies.

The abbÃ© did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but DantÃ¨s knew it,
and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,
between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.
This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It
is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been
thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.
DantÃ¨s drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave DantÃ¨s
advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But
DantÃ¨s was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.
It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in
which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the
suspicion of his madness, increased Edmondâ€™s admiration of him; but at
the same time DantÃ¨s could not believe that the deposit, supposing it
had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure
as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.

However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last
chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to
perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on
the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had
repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the
hole DantÃ¨s had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it
will be remembered, the abbÃ© had made to Edmond, the misfortune would
have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been
detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a
stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the
realization of their hopes.

â€œYou see,â€ said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to
Faria, â€œthat God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for
what you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever
with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure
will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this
prison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits
me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our
living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is
the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages
you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with
all their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you
have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of
them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced
themâ€”this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have
made me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better
for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as
problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the
sea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as
we draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear
your eloquent speech,â€”which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,
and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I
should ever be free,â€”so fills my whole existence, that the despair to
which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no
longer any hold over me; and thisâ€”this is my fortuneâ€”not chimerical,
but actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the
sovereigns of the earth, even CÃ¦sar Borgia himself, could not deprive
me of this.â€

Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed
together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence
as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied
would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left
leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was
continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,
and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might
be some day lost or stolen, he compelled DantÃ¨s to learn it by heart;
and DantÃ¨s knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed
the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would
be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed
while Faria was giving instructions to DantÃ¨s,â€”instructions which were
to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and
hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,
which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone
under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to
endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed
spot,â€”the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in
the second opening.

In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand
and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had
gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his
youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who
learns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually
employed,â€”Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; DantÃ¨s, for
fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his
memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for
them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose
activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of
Providence.

But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young
man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many
stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when
Edmond returned to his cell.

One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone
calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or
rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached
him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.
Undoubtedly the call came from Fariaâ€™s dungeon.

â€œAlas,â€ murmured Edmond; â€œcan it be?â€

He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and
reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the
light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,
DantÃ¨s saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.
His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he
already knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them
for the first time.

â€œAlas, my dear friend,â€ said Faria in a resigned tone, â€œyou understand,
do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?â€

Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed
towards the door, exclaiming, â€œHelp, help!â€

Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.

â€œSilence,â€ he said, â€œor you are lost. We must now only think of you, my
dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your
flight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done
here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew
we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear
Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;
some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you
will appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,
strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,
while I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead
body tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence
has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,
and it was time I should die.â€

Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, â€œOh, my friend, my
friend, speak not thus!â€ and then resuming all his presence of mind,
which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,
which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, â€œOh, I have
saved you once, and I will save you a second time!â€ And raising the
foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the
red liquor.

â€œSee,â€ he exclaimed, â€œthere remains still some of the magic draught.
Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh
instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.â€

â€œThere is not a hope,â€ replied Faria, shaking his head, â€œbut no matter;
God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so
profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to
preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet
always so dear.â€

â€œOh, yes, yes!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s; â€œand I tell you that I will save you
yet.â€

â€œWell, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing
towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter
and seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in
five minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an
hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.â€

â€œOh!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s, his heart wrung with anguish.

â€œDo as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of
life are now exhausted in me, and death,â€ he continued, looking at his
paralyzed arm and leg, â€œhas but half its work to do. If, after having
made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not
recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for
I can no longer support myself.â€

Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.

â€œAnd now, my dear friend,â€ said Faria, â€œsole consolation of my wretched
existence,â€”you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a
priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,â€”at the moment of
separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the
prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!â€

The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the
old manâ€™s bed.

â€œListen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of
the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by
time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes
pierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight
of so much riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbÃ©, whom
all the world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristoâ€”avail
yourself of the fortuneâ€”for you have indeed suffered long enough.â€

A violent convulsion attacked the old man. DantÃ¨s raised his head and
saw Fariaâ€™s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood
had ascended from the chest to the head.

â€œAdieu, adieu!â€ murmured the old man, clasping Edmondâ€™s hand
convulsivelyâ€”â€œadieu!â€

â€œOh, no,â€”no, not yet,â€ he cried; â€œdo not forsake me! Oh, succor him!
Helpâ€”helpâ€”help!â€

â€œHush! hush!â€ murmured the dying man, â€œthat they may not separate us if
you save me!â€

â€œYou are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,
although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you
were before.â€

â€œDo not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to
endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth
to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, â€™tis
hereâ€”â€™tis hereâ€”â€™tis overâ€”my sight is goneâ€”my senses fail! Your hand,
DantÃ¨s! Adieu! adieu!â€

And raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his
faculties, he said,â€”â€œMonte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!â€ And he
fell back on the bed.

The crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen
eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture,
in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.

DantÃ¨s took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,
whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the
distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze
he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.

When he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,
pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before,
counted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial
contained, perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a
quarter of an hour, half an hour,â€”no change took place. Trembling, his
hair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds
by the beating of his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the
last trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and
without having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained
extended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat.

0255m



The draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded
the old manâ€™s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon
them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed
body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining
open.

Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this
period of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to
his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heartâ€™s
pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it
stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid,
the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed.

It was six oâ€™clock in the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and its
feeble ray came into the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of
the lamp. Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man,
and at times gave it the appearance of life. While the struggle between
day and night lasted, DantÃ¨s still doubted; but as soon as the daylight
gained the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then
an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not
again press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze
on those fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but
in vainâ€”they opened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp,
carefully concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could
the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.

It was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began his
rounds at DantÃ¨sâ€™ cell, and on leaving him he went on to Fariaâ€™s
dungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened
that the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.

DantÃ¨s was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was
going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore
returned by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the
exclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys
came, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all
came the governor.

Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard
the voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead
manâ€™s face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner
did not recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out,
and words of pity fell on DantÃ¨sâ€™ listening ears, mingled with brutal
laughter.

â€œWell, well,â€ said one, â€œthe madman has gone to look after his
treasure. Good journey to him!â€

â€œWith all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!â€
said another.

â€œOh,â€ added a third voice, â€œthe shrouds of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If are not
dear!â€

0257m



â€œPerhaps,â€ said one of the previous speakers, â€œas he was a churchman,
they may go to some expense in his behalf.â€

â€œThey may give him the honors of the sack.â€

Edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was
said. The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had
left the cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left
some turnkey to watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and
motionless, hardly venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he
heard a faint noise, which increased. It was the governor who returned,
followed by the doctor and other attendants. There was a momentâ€™s
silence,â€”it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body.
The inquiries soon commenced.

The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner
had succumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers
followed in a nonchalant manner that made DantÃ¨s indignant, for he felt
that all the world should have for the poor abbÃ© a love and respect
equal to his own.

â€œI am very sorry for what you tell me,â€ said the governor, replying to
the assurance of the doctor, â€œthat the old man is really dead; for he
was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no
watching.â€

â€œAh,â€ added the turnkey, â€œthere was no occasion for watching him; he
would have stayed here fifty years, Iâ€™ll answer for it, without any
attempt to escape.â€

â€œStill,â€ said the governor, â€œI believe it will be requisite,
notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but
in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured
that the prisoner is dead.â€

There was a moment of complete silence, during which DantÃ¨s, still
listening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.

â€œYou may make your mind easy,â€ said the doctor; â€œhe is dead. I will
answer for that.â€

â€œYou know, sir,â€ said the governor, persisting, â€œthat we are not
content in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite
of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by
fulfilling the formalities described by law.â€

â€œLet the irons be heated,â€ said the doctor; â€œbut really it is a useless
precaution.â€

This order to heat the irons made DantÃ¨s shudder. He heard hasty steps,
the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes
afterwards a turnkey entered, saying:

â€œHere is the brazier, lighted.â€

There was a momentâ€™s silence, and then was heard the crackling of
burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even
behind the wall where DantÃ¨s was listening in horror. The perspiration
poured forth upon the young manâ€™s brow, and he felt as if he should
faint.

â€œYou see, sir, he is really dead,â€ said the doctor; â€œthis burn in the
heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered
from his captivity.â€

â€œWasnâ€™t his name Faria?â€ inquired one of the officers who accompanied
the governor.

0259m



â€œYes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very
learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his
treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.â€

â€œIt is the sort of malady which we call monomania,â€ said the doctor.

â€œYou had never anything to complain of?â€ said the governor to the
jailer who had charge of the abbÃ©.

â€œNever, sir,â€ replied the jailer, â€œnever; on the contrary, he sometimes
amused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife
was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.â€

â€œAh, ah!â€ said the doctor, â€œI did not know that I had a rival; but I
hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in
consequence.â€

â€œYes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the
newest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?â€

â€œMust this last formality take place in your presence, sir?â€ inquired a
turnkey.

â€œCertainly. But make hasteâ€”I cannot stay here all day.â€ Other
footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards
the noise of rustling canvas reached DantÃ¨sâ€™ ears, the bed creaked, and
the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor;
then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.

â€œThis evening,â€ said the governor.

â€œWill there be any mass?â€ asked one of the attendants.

â€œThat is impossible,â€ replied the governor. â€œThe chaplain of the
chÃ¢teau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to
take a trip to HyÃ¨res for a week. I told him I would attend to the
prisoners in his absence. If the poor abbÃ© had not been in such a
hurry, he might have had his requiem.â€

â€œPooh, pooh;â€ said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his
profession; â€œhe is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and
not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.â€ A shout
of laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of
putting the body in the sack was going on.

â€œThis evening,â€ said the governor, when the task was ended.

â€œAt what hour?â€ inquired a turnkey.

â€œWhy, about ten or eleven oâ€™clock.â€

â€œShall we watch by the corpse?â€

â€œOf what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were aliveâ€”that is
all.â€

Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the
noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a
silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,â€”the silence of death,
which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of
DantÃ¨s.

Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked
carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and DantÃ¨s emerged from the
tunnel.



 Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If

On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light
that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude
folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Fariaâ€™s last
winding-sheet,â€”a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so
little. Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between
DantÃ¨s and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those
wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of
death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make
his existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion,
with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed.
He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into
melancholy and gloomy reverie.

Alone! he was alone again! again condemned to silenceâ€”again face to
face with nothingness! Alone!â€”never again to see the face, never again
to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! Was
not Fariaâ€™s fate the better, after allâ€”to solve the problem of life at
its source, even at the risk of horrible suffering?

The idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by
his cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbÃ©â€™s dead
body.

â€œIf I could die,â€ he said, â€œI should go where he goes, and should
assuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,â€ he went on
with a smile; â€œI will remain here, rush on the first person that opens
the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.â€

But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is
tossed from the depths to the top of the wave. DantÃ¨s recoiled from the
idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an
ardent desire for life and liberty.

â€œDie? oh, no,â€ he exclaimedâ€”â€œnot die now, after having lived and
suffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now
to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I
want to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back
the happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not
forget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who
knows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I
shall die in my dungeon like Faria.â€

As he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like
one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,
lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or
thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.

â€œJust God!â€ he muttered, â€œwhence comes this thought? Is it from thee?
Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the
place of the dead!â€

Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,
that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his
desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with
the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore
it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied
around its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it
with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried
vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the
head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the
evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;
entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to
the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung
off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse
canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in
which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack
from the inside.

He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any
mischance the jailers had entered at that moment. DantÃ¨s might have
waited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the
governor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed
earlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.

Now his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If
while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that
they were bearing a live instead of a dead body, DantÃ¨s did not intend
to give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,
he meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their
alarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to
better purpose.

0263m



If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would
allow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the
grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would
have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped
that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not
overcome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy,
he would be stifled, and thenâ€”so much the better, all would be over.

DantÃ¨s had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not
thought of hunger, nor did he think of it now. His situation was too
precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one.

The first risk that DantÃ¨s ran was, that the jailer, when he brought
him his supper at seven oâ€™clock, might perceive the change that had
been made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or
fatigue, DantÃ¨s had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed
his bread and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word.
This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to
DantÃ¨s, and seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus
discover all.

When seven oâ€™clock came, DantÃ¨sâ€™ agony really began. His hand placed
upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the
other he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time
chills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of
ice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on
without any unusual disturbance, and DantÃ¨s knew that he had escaped
the first peril. It was a good augury.

At length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were
heard on the stairs. Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned
up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at
the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins. The
footstepsâ€”they were doubleâ€”paused at the doorâ€”and DantÃ¨s guessed that
the two grave-diggers had come to seek himâ€”this idea was soon converted
into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the
hand-bier.

The door opened, and a dim light reached DantÃ¨sâ€™ eyes through the
coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a
third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. The two men,
approaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.

â€œHeâ€™s heavy, though, for an old and thin man,â€ said one, as he raised
the head.

â€œThey say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,â€
said another, lifting the feet.

â€œHave you tied the knot?â€ inquired the first speaker.

â€œWhat would be the use of carrying so much more weight?â€ was the reply,
â€œI can do that when we get there.â€

â€œYes, youâ€™re right,â€ replied the companion.

â€œWhatâ€™s the knot for?â€ thought DantÃ¨s.

They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened
himself in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party,
lighted by the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs.
Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, and DantÃ¨s knew that
the mistral was blowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain
were strangely mingled.

The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier
down on the ground. One of them went away, and DantÃ¨s heard his shoes
striking on the pavement.

â€œWhere am I?â€ he asked himself.

â€œReally, he is by no means a light load!â€ said the other bearer,
sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow.

DantÃ¨sâ€™ first impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt
it.

â€œGive us a light,â€ said the other bearer, â€œor I shall never find what I
am looking for.â€

The man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite
terms.

â€œWhat can he be looking for?â€ thought Edmond. â€œThe spade, perhaps.â€

An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had
found the object of his search. â€œHere it is at last,â€ he said, â€œnot
without some trouble, though.â€

â€œYes,â€ was the answer, â€œbut it has lost nothing by waiting.â€

As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy
metallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord
was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.

â€œWell, have you tied the knot?â€ inquired the grave-digger, who was
looking on.

â€œYes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,â€ was the answer.

â€œMove on, then.â€ And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.

They advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door,
then went forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the
rocks on which the chÃ¢teau is built, reached DantÃ¨sâ€™ ear distinctly as
they went forward.

â€œBad weather!â€ observed one of the bearers; â€œnot a pleasant night for a
dip in the sea.â€

â€œWhy, yes, the abbÃ© runs a chance of being wet,â€ said the other; and
then there was a burst of brutal laughter.

DantÃ¨s did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his
head.

â€œWell, here we are at last,â€ said one of them.

â€œA little fartherâ€”a little farther,â€ said the other. â€œYou know very
well that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the
governor told us next day that we were careless fellows.â€

They ascended five or six more steps, and then DantÃ¨s felt that they
took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to
and fro.

â€œOne!â€ said the grave-diggers, â€œtwo! three!â€

And at the same instant DantÃ¨s felt himself flung into the air like a
wounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood
curdle. Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his
rapid descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century. At
last, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold
water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a moment by
his immersion beneath the waves.

DantÃ¨s had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by
a thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet.

The sea is the cemetery of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If.

0267m




 Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen

DantÃ¨s, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence
of mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was
for every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack,
extricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts
to free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still
lower. He then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the
cord that bound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were
actually strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the
sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so
nearly become his shroud.

DantÃ¨s waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid
being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where
he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across
which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a
twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters,
sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the
approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the
sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags
seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock
was a torch lighting two figures.

He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless
these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. DantÃ¨s dived again, and
remained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him,
for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the
lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously
declared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the
light had disappeared.

He must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and PomÃ¨gue are the nearest
islands of all those that surround the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, but Ratonneau and
PomÃ¨gue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and
Lemaire were therefore the safest for DantÃ¨sâ€™ venture. The islands of
Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If; DantÃ¨s,
nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his
way in the darkness of the night?

At this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him
like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of
Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he
would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the
ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him,
when he saw him idle and inactive:

â€œDantÃ¨s, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be
drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly
exercised and prepared for exertion.â€

These words rang in DantÃ¨sâ€™ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened
to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength.
He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his
power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he
had so often sported as a boy.

Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged DantÃ¨sâ€™ efforts. He listened for
any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top
of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he
redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the
chÃ¢teau, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the
terrible chÃ¢teau had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it,
but he _felt_ its presence.

An hour passed, during which DantÃ¨s, excited by the feeling of freedom,
continued to cleave the waves.

â€œLet us see,â€ said he, â€œI have swum above an hour, but as the wind is
against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken,
I must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?â€

A shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest
himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not
make use of this means of recuperation.

â€œWell,â€ said he, â€œI will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp
seizes me, and then I shall sink;â€ and he struck out with the energy of
despair.

Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense,
and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he
felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been
shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put
out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew
that he had gained the shore.

Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so
much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent
combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. DantÃ¨s rose, advanced a few
steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on
the granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of
the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter
exhaustion. At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the
roar of thunder. The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere
with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched
across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that
rolled on in vast chaotic waves.

DantÃ¨s had not been deceivedâ€”he had reached the first of the two
islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and
without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to
plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but
larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.

An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had
he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves,
dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was
safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of
the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to
him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a
vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of
the storm.

He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty
hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that
had lodged in a hollow of the rock.

As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest
heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the
Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant,
DantÃ¨s saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the
power of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching
with frightful rapidity. DantÃ¨s cried at the top of his voice to warn
them of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed
him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a
fifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him
undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind.
Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly
the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the
darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.

At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.
DantÃ¨s from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the
fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark
again.

DantÃ¨s ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to
pieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothingâ€”the
cries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the
wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue
firmament appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became
visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them,
and gilded their foaming crests with gold. It was day.

DantÃ¨s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if
he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in
the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be
witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and
land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with
imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five
oâ€™clock. The sea continued to get calmer.

â€œIn two or three hours,â€ thought DantÃ¨s, â€œthe turnkey will enter my
chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in
vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men
who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered,
will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue
the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter
to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles
will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I
am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my
God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what
I am unable to do for myself.â€

As DantÃ¨s (his eyes turned in the direction of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If)
uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of
PomÃ¨gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in
search of prey; and with his sailorâ€™s eye he knew it to be a Genoese
tartan. She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out
to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.

â€œOh,â€ cried Edmond, â€œto think that in half an hour I could join her,
did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to
Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of
trading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will
prefer selling me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannotâ€”I
am starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted;
besides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as
one of the sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for
there is no one left to contradict me.â€

As he spoke, DantÃ¨s looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had
been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a
point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vesselâ€™s
keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant DantÃ¨sâ€™ plan was
formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the
timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was
taking.

â€œI am saved!â€ murmured he. And this conviction restored his strength.

He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking
between the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he
feared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea;
but he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy,
between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne.

However, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and
in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of
him. He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on
board saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. DantÃ¨s would have
shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.

It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for
without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the
vesselâ€”certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in
attracting attention.

DantÃ¨s, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had
yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he
advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her
course. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his
cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was
both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At
the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.

An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards
him. DantÃ¨s let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,
and swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his
strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to
him. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was
almost breathless.

He shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of
them cried in Italian, â€œCourage!â€

The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength
to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface,
struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a
third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were
again tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky
turned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He
felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had
fainted.

When he opened his eyes DantÃ¨s found himself on the deck of the tartan.
His first care was to see what course they were taking. They were
rapidly leaving the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If behind. DantÃ¨s was so exhausted that
the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.

As we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his
limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who
had cried out â€œCourage!â€ held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while
the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with
that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped
yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.

A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction
of his limbs restored their elasticity.

â€œWho are you?â€ said the pilot in bad French.

â€œI am,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, in bad Italian, â€œa Maltese sailor. We were
coming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook
us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.â€

â€œWhere do you come from?â€

â€œFrom these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our
captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and
fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a
piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my
life, and I thank you,â€ continued DantÃ¨s. â€œI was lost when one of your
sailors caught hold of my hair.â€

â€œIt was I,â€ said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; â€œand it was
time, for you were sinking.â€

â€œYes,â€ returned DantÃ¨s, holding out his hand, â€œI thank you again.â€

â€œI almost hesitated, though,â€ replied the sailor; â€œyou looked more like
a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair
a foot long.â€

DantÃ¨s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the
time he was at the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If.

â€œYes,â€ said he, â€œI made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my
hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but
today the vow expires.â€

â€œNow what are we to do with you?â€ said the captain.

â€œAlas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped;
but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be
sure to find employment.â€

â€œDo you know the Mediterranean?â€

â€œI have sailed over it since my childhood.â€

â€œYou know the best harbors?â€

â€œThere are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage
over my eyes.â€

â€œI say, captain,â€ said the sailor who had cried â€œCourage!â€ to DantÃ¨s,
â€œif what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?â€

â€œIf he says true,â€ said the captain doubtingly. â€œBut in his present
condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it
afterwards.â€

â€œI will do more than I promise,â€ said DantÃ¨s.

â€œWe shall see,â€ returned the other, smiling.

â€œWhere are you going?â€ asked DantÃ¨s.

â€œTo Leghorn.â€

â€œThen why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the
wind?â€

â€œBecause we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.â€

â€œYou shall pass it by twenty fathoms.â€

â€œTake the helm, and let us see what you know.â€

The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the
rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she
yet was tolerably obedient.

â€œTo the sheets,â€ said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew,
obeyed, while the pilot looked on. â€œHaul taut.â€

They obeyed.

â€œBelay.â€ This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as DantÃ¨s
had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.

â€œBravo!â€ said the captain.

â€œBravo!â€ repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at
this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor
they had not thought him capable of showing.

â€œYou see,â€ said DantÃ¨s, quitting the helm, â€œI shall be of some use to
you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you
can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get,
for my food and the clothes you lend me.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the captain, â€œwe can agree very well, if you are
reasonable.â€

â€œGive me what you give the others, and it will be all right,â€ returned
DantÃ¨s.

â€œThatâ€™s not fair,â€ said the seaman who had saved DantÃ¨s; â€œfor you know
more than we do.â€

â€œWhat is that to you, Jacopo?â€ returned the Captain. â€œEveryone is free
to ask what he pleases.â€

â€œThatâ€™s true,â€ replied Jacopo; â€œI only make a remark.â€

â€œWell, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of
trousers, if you have them.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Jacopo; â€œbut I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.â€

â€œThat is all I want,â€ interrupted DantÃ¨s. Jacopo dived into the hold
and soon returned with what Edmond wanted.

â€œNow, then, do you wish for anything else?â€ said the patron.

â€œA piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I
have not eaten or drunk for a long time.â€ He had not tasted food for
forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the
gourd.

â€œLarboard your helm,â€ cried the captain to the steersman. DantÃ¨s
glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with
hand in mid-air.

â€œHollo! whatâ€™s the matter at the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If?â€ said the captain.

A small white cloud, which had attracted DantÃ¨sâ€™ attention, crowned the
summit of the bastion of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If. At the same moment the faint
report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.

â€œWhat is this?â€ asked the captain.

â€œA prisoner has escaped from the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, and they are firing the
alarm gun,â€ replied DantÃ¨s. The captain glanced at him, but he had
lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure,
that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.

0277m



â€œPretty strong rum! â€œ said DantÃ¨s, wiping his brow with his sleeve.

â€œAt any rate,â€ murmured he, â€œif it be, so much the better, for I have
made a rare acquisition.â€

0279m



Under pretence of being fatigued, DantÃ¨s asked to take the helm; the
steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter
by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. DantÃ¨s
could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.

â€œWhat is the day of the month?â€ asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside
him.

â€œThe 28th of February.â€

â€œIn what year?â€

â€œIn what yearâ€”you ask me in what year?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the young man, â€œI ask you in what year!â€

â€œYou have forgotten then?â€

â€œI got such a fright last night,â€ replied DantÃ¨s, smiling, â€œthat I have
almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?â€

â€œThe year 1829,â€ returned Jacopo.

It was fourteen years, day for day, since DantÃ¨sâ€™ arrest. He was
nineteen when he entered the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If; he was thirty-three when he
escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what
had become of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes
lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused
him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars,
Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in
his dungeon.

This oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the
Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan,
that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to
Leghorn.



 Chapter 22. The Smugglers

DantÃ¨s had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of
the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the
school of the AbbÃ© Faria, the worthy master of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ (the
name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken
on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the
Arabic to the ProvenÃ§al, and this, while it spared him interpreters,
persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great
facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea,
with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people
without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays
of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must
suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible
means of support. It is fair to assume that DantÃ¨s was on board a
smuggler.

At first the captain had received DantÃ¨s on board with a certain degree
of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the
coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual
battle of wits, he had at first thought that DantÃ¨s might be an
emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who
perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets
of his trade. But the skilful manner in which DantÃ¨s had handled the
lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light
plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, and
heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he
had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings,
was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy,
it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs
officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he
beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.

Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without
the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew
tried to â€œpumpâ€ him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave
accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as
Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese,
subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild
demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded.
Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd
persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing
but what they should believe.

In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here
Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he
could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen
years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth
had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades
believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at
Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there
to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this
man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head
the appearance of one of Titianâ€™s portraits. At this period it was not
the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber
would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should
consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said
nothing and went to work.

When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was
completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked
for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty
years of age, and his fourteen yearsâ€™ imprisonment had produced a great
transformation in his appearance.

DantÃ¨s had entered the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If with the round, open, smiling face
of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been
smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This
was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth
had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his
eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes
were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled
gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept
from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features
are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of
the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused
over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also
acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame
possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.

0283m



To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity
of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and
imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly
penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.

Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had
acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to
the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was
impossible that his best friendâ€”if, indeed, he had any friend
leftâ€”could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.

The master of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_, who was very desirous of retaining
amongst his crew a man of Edmondâ€™s value, had offered to advance him
funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next
care on leaving the barberâ€™s who had achieved his first metamorphosis
was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailorâ€™s suitâ€”a garb, as we all
know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,
and a cap.

It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and
trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of
the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before
he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man
with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body
soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.
Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an
engagement to DantÃ¨s; but DantÃ¨s, who had his own projects, would not
agree for a longer time than three months.

_La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ had a very active crew, very obedient to their
captain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a
week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed
muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the
excise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this
out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica,
where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France.

They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the
first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in
prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and
went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon.

The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the
patron found DantÃ¨s leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense
earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged
with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo.

_La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard
and kept on for Corsica. DantÃ¨s thought, as they passed so closely to
the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to
leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then
what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without
arms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would
the patron think? He must wait.

Fortunately, DantÃ¨s had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen
years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six
months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without
riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches
chimerical?â€”offspring of the brain of the poor AbbÃ© Faria, had they not
died with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was
singularly circumstantial, and DantÃ¨s repeated it to himself, from one
end to the other, for he had not forgotten a word.

0285m



Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of
twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own,
for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to
behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn
broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening
saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal
for landing, for a shipâ€™s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead
of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. DantÃ¨s
noticed that the captain of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ had, as he neared the
land, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise,
can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.

But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything
proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came
off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in
acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the
sea, and the five boats worked so well that by two oâ€™clock in the
morning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ and on _terra
firma_. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of _La
Jeune AmÃ©lie_, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred
Tuscan livres, or about eighty francs.

But the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards
Sardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace
what had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the
first, _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ was in luck. This new cargo was destined for
the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of
Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.

There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the
excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune
AmÃ©lie_. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded;
DantÃ¨s was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left
shoulder. DantÃ¨s was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at
being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what
eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear
suffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded
had exclaimed with the great philosopher, â€œPain, thou art not an evil.â€

He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death,
and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill
of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.
DantÃ¨s was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the
end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in
his bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and
rushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all
the kindness of a devoted comrade.

This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither
was it so wicked as DantÃ¨s thought it, since this man, who had nothing
to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the
prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.
Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain
herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old
Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try
Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his
prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.

As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first
bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of
affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that
Edmond had a right to superiority of positionâ€”a superiority which
Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness
which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.

Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with
security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the
helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,
with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor
AbbÃ© Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of
the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught
him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call
heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.

And when Jacopo inquired of him, â€œWhat is the use of teaching all these
things to a poor sailor like me?â€ Edmond replied, â€œWho knows? You may
one day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte,
became emperor.â€ We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.

Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as
skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an
acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the
Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had
passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not
once had he found an opportunity of landing there.

He then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron
of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own
accountâ€”for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred
piastresâ€”and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo.
Then he would be free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at
liberty, for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied
him. But in this world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond
prudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain
did he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any
plan for reaching the island without companionship.

DantÃ¨s was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron,
who had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him
in his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern
on the Via delâ€™ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to
congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already
DantÃ¨s had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing
all these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly
two hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might
not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all
these contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter
that was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey
carpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find
some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try
and land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was
successful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty
or sixty piastres each for the crew.

The patron of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ proposed as a place of landing the
Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having
neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in
the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by
Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we
in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which
antiquity appears to have included in the same category.

At the mention of Monte Cristo DantÃ¨s started with joy; he rose to
conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all
the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_.

When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the
matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and
set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion
that the island afforded every possible security, and that great
enterprises to be well done should be done quickly.

Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get
under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the
neutral island by the following day.

0289m




 Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo

Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which
sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an
evil destiny, DantÃ¨s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for,
by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring
any suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way.

The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions,
good and evil, passed through DantÃ¨sâ€™ mind. If he closed his eyes, he
saw Cardinal Spadaâ€™s letter written on the wall in characters of
flameâ€”if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He
ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and
the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as
subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed,
wonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then
returned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all
changed into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the
marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path
became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he
tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the
splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless,
the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom
for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.

The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had
been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and DantÃ¨s was
then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and
unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for
departure, and these preparations served to conceal DantÃ¨sâ€™ agitation.
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he
was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always
clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with
celerity and pleasure.

The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the
superiority of DantÃ¨s over the crew and himself. He saw in the young
man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter,
that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At
seven oâ€™clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past
seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The
sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed
beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his
beacon lights, each of which is a world. DantÃ¨s told them that all
hands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for
so they called DantÃ¨s) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went
to their bunks contentedly.

This frequently happened. DantÃ¨s, cast from solitude into the world,
frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what
solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship
floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in
the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?

Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up
by his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When
the patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and
every sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an
hour. The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond
resigned the lugger to the masterâ€™s care, and went and lay down in his
hammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his
eyes for a moment.

Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double
the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the
flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo
reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. DantÃ¨s
ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa
to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or
three knots. About five oâ€™clock in the evening the island was distinct,
and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness
of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast
at its setting.

Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the
variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest
blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and
a mist passed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune
is staked on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond
felt in his paroxysms of hope.

Night came, and at ten oâ€™clock they anchored. _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ was
first at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual command over himself,
DantÃ¨s could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on
shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have â€œkissed his
mother earth.â€ It was dark, but at eleven oâ€™clock the moon rose in the
midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, â€œascending
high,â€ played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second
Pelion.

The island was familiar to the crew of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_,â€”it was one of
her regular haunts. As to DantÃ¨s, he had passed it on his voyage to and
from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.

â€œWhere shall we pass the night?â€ he inquired.

â€œWhy, on board the tartan,â€ replied the sailor.

â€œShould we not do better in the grottos?â€

â€œWhat grottos?â€

â€œWhy, the grottosâ€”caves of the island.â€

â€œI do not know of any grottos,â€ replied Jacopo.

The cold sweat sprang forth on DantÃ¨sâ€™ brow.

â€œWhat, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?â€ he asked.

â€œNone.â€

For a moment DantÃ¨s was speechless; then he remembered that these caves
might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the
sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to
discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and
DantÃ¨s therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides,
a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_
replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had
come.

The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was
well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast
anchor within a cableâ€™s length of shore.

Then the landing began. DantÃ¨s reflected, as he worked, on the shout of
joy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he
gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart;
but, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he
had already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual
questions, his minute observations and evident preoccupation, aroused
suspicions. Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his
painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the
glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but
transitory.

No one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a
fowling-piece, powder, and shot, DantÃ¨s declared his intention to go
and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to
rock, his wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for
solitude. However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and DantÃ¨s did not
oppose this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust.
Scarcely, however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having
killed a kid, he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request
them to cook it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This
and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of
fare.

DantÃ¨s went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him.
Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath
him, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy
preparing the repast which Edmondâ€™s skill as a marksman had augmented
with a capital dish.

Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a
man superior to his fellows.

â€œIn two hoursâ€™ time,â€ said he, â€œthese persons will depart richer by
fifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to
gain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred
francs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans
and the insolence of nabobs. At this moment hope makes me despise their
riches, which seem to me contemptible. Yet perchance tomorrow deception
will so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a
contemptible possession as the utmost happiness. Oh, no!â€ exclaimed
Edmond, â€œthat will not be. The wise, unerring Faria could not be
mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it were better to die than to
continue to lead this low and wretched life.â€

Thus DantÃ¨s, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had
now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in
DantÃ¨s, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has
filled him with boundless desires.

Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn
by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never
before trod, DantÃ¨s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos
must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest
object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain
rocks, marks made by the hand of man.

Time, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as
it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have
respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree
of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the
marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes
laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to
separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the
guide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes.
Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them,
in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event
of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so
complete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements
of a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying
marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and
had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious
secret?

0295m



It seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the
inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the
marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock,
placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to
lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end
of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore
turned round and retraced his steps.

Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from
a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at
the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they
saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock,
and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed
his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they
watched his daring progress, Edmondâ€™s foot slipped, and they saw him
stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards
him, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo
reached him first.

He found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had
rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little
rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so
beneficial to him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened
his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness
in his head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to
the shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopoâ€™s
directions, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to
be moved.

It may be supposed that DantÃ¨s did not now think of his dinner, but he
insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should
have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a
little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The
sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of
the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very
ceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been
able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean
against a moss-grown rock.

But, instead of growing easier, DantÃ¨sâ€™ pains appeared to increase in
violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in
order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France,
between Nice and FrÃ©jus, urged DantÃ¨s to try and rise. Edmond made
great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back,
moaning and turning pale.

â€œHe has broken his ribs,â€ said the commander, in a low voice. â€œNo
matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will
try and carry him on board the tartan.â€

DantÃ¨s declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than
undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.

â€œWell,â€ said the patron, â€œlet what may happen, it shall never be said
that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.â€

This very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it.
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever
seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. DantÃ¨s
would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules
should be made in his favor.

â€œNo, no,â€ he said to the patron, â€œI was awkward, and it is just that I
pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a
gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and
a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for
me.â€

â€œBut youâ€™ll die of hunger,â€ said the patron.

â€œI would rather do so,â€ was Edmondâ€™s reply, â€œthan suffer the
inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.â€

The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in
the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea
when her toilet should be completed.

â€œWhat are we to do, Maltese?â€ asked the captain. â€œWe cannot leave you
here so, and yet we cannot stay.â€

â€œGo, go!â€ exclaimed DantÃ¨s.

â€œWe shall be absent at least a week,â€ said the patron, â€œand then we
must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.â€

â€œWhy,â€ said DantÃ¨s, â€œif in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat,
desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my
passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.â€
The patron shook his head.

â€œListen, Captain Baldi; thereâ€™s one way of settling this,â€ said Jacopo.
â€œDo you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.â€

â€œAnd give up your share of the venture,â€ said Edmond, â€œto remain with
me?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Jacopo, â€œand without any hesitation.â€

â€œYou are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,â€ replied Edmond,
â€œand heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do
not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up,
and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent
for bruises.â€

A peculiar smile passed over DantÃ¨sâ€™ lips; he squeezed Jacopoâ€™s hand
warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remainâ€”and remain
alone.

The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but
not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of
a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if
he could not move the rest of his body.

Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,â€”â€œâ€™Tis strange
that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and
devotion.â€ Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock,
from which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan
complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing
herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set
sail.

At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was
impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot
where he was. Then DantÃ¨s rose more agile and light than the kid among
the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand,
his pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the
marks he had noted terminated.

â€œAnd now,â€ he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman,
which Faria had related to him, â€œnow, Open Sesame!â€



 Chapter 24. The Secret Cave

The sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell
full on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.
Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a
monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees
waved and rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he
disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off
he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island
was inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of
God.

He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadâ€”that dread of
the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and
observed. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was
about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his
gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed
round in every direction.

But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could
distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its
historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to
the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the
proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the
brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just
set sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.

The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other,
following an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of
Corsica.

This sight reassured him. He then looked at the objects near him. He
saw that he was on the highest point of the island,â€”a statue on this
vast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the
blue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a
fringe of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he
dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned
should happen in reality.

DantÃ¨s, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he
had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the
bath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its
mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small
vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from
observation.

Then following the clew that, in the hands of the AbbÃ© Faria, had been
so skilfully used to guide him through the DÃ¦dalian labyrinth of
probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be
watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed
the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had
buried his treasure. It was this idea that had brought DantÃ¨s back to
the circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his
theory. How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been
lifted to this spot, without the aid of many men?

Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind. Instead of raising it,
thought he, they have lowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order
to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.

He soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid
along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large stone
had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it,
so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered
with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the
stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to
the earth.

0301m



DantÃ¨s dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he
detected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by
the hand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutesâ€™ labor the wall
gave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.

DantÃ¨s went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped
off its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But
the rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone
man, were he Hercules himself. DantÃ¨s saw that he must attack the
wedge. But how?

He cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his
friend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would
serve him for this purpose.

With the aid of his pickaxe, DantÃ¨s, after the manner of a labor-saving
pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported
it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his
handkerchief in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired.

The explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by
the terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces;
thousands of insects escaped from the aperture DantÃ¨s had previously
formed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure,
rolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.

DantÃ¨s approached the upper rock, which now, without any support,
leaned towards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it,
and, selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to
attack, placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every
nerve to move the mass.

The rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base. DantÃ¨s
redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who
uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods. The rock
yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally
disappeared in the ocean.

On the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring
let into a square flag-stone.

DantÃ¨s uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt
been crowned with more perfect success. He would fain have continued,
but his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight
became so dim, that he was forced to pause.

This feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the
ring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and
disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of
a subterraneous grotto.

Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy. DantÃ¨s turned pale,
hesitated, and reflected.

â€œCome,â€ said he to himself, â€œbe a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I
must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived. What,
then, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when,
after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions
destroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no
treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, CÃ¦sar Borgia,
the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has
followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done,
raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.â€

He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy
aperture that was open at his feet.

â€œNow that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the
slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of
curiosity.â€ And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.

â€œYes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of
that royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long
chain of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a
sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock,
perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master
descended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his
awe-inspiring progress.â€

0303m



â€œBut what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?â€
asked DantÃ¨s of himself.

â€œThe fate,â€ replied he, smiling, â€œof those who buried Alaric, and were
interred with the corpse.â€

â€œYet, had he come,â€ thought DantÃ¨s, â€œhe would have found the treasure,
and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could
devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in
replacing this rock. I will go down.â€

Then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of
human philosophy, â€œPerhaps!â€

But instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he
had expected to find, DantÃ¨s saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well
as the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but
by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from
without, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the
waving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers
that grew from the rocks.

After having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which
was rather warm than damp, DantÃ¨sâ€™ eye, habituated as it was to
darkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which
was of granite that sparkled like diamonds.

â€œAlas,â€ said Edmond, smiling, â€œthese are the treasures the cardinal has
left; and the good abbÃ©, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has
indulged in fallacious hopes.â€

But he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart.
â€œIn the farthest angle of the second opening,â€ said the cardinalâ€™s
will. He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the
second. DantÃ¨s continued his search. He reflected that this second
grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones,
and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed,
masked for precautionâ€™s sake.

The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of
DantÃ¨sâ€™ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him
that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he
eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but
a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening
must be.

However, he, like CÃ¦sar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order
to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his
pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing
that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence
issued the consoling sound he had before heard.

He again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing
occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used
in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in
flakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been
closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to
imitate granite. DantÃ¨s struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which
entered someway between the interstices.

It was there he must dig.

But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that
Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give
way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him. This last proof,
instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe
descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand
over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an
excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in
reality because he felt that he was about to faint.

The island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery
glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the
blue ocean.

DantÃ¨s had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a
moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the
cavern.

The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his
grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. After several blows he
perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed
one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of
his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the
stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.

He had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe
to draw the stones towards him one by one. The aperture was already
sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still
cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after
renewed hesitation, DantÃ¨s entered the second grotto.

The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air
that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic
smell DantÃ¨s was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited
in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then
went on.

At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to DantÃ¨sâ€™
eye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it
was, like the first, empty.

The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at
length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and DantÃ¨sâ€™ fate would be
decided.

He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution,
attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the
pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell,
never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had
DantÃ¨s found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.

He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same
resistance, but not the same sound.

â€œIt is a casket of wood bound with iron,â€ thought he.

At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; DantÃ¨s
seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A
wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a
little distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure
his dinner; but DantÃ¨s feared lest the report of his gun should attract
attention.

He thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the
fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended
with this torch.

He wished to see everything. He approached the hole he had dug, and
now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in reality
struck against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground and
resumed his labor.

In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared,
and DantÃ¨s could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut steel; in the
middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was still
untarnished, the arms of the Spada familyâ€”viz., a sword, _en pale_, on
an oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmounted
by a cardinalâ€™s hat.

DantÃ¨s easily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.
There was no longer any doubt: the treasure was thereâ€”no one would have
been at such pains to conceal an empty casket. In an instant he had
cleared every obstacle away, and he saw successively the lock, placed
between two padlocks, and the two handles at each end, all carved as
things were carved at that epoch, when art rendered the commonest
metals precious.

DantÃ¨s seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was
impossible. He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these
faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust. DantÃ¨s
inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid,
and pressing with all his force on the handle, burst open the
fastenings. The hinges yielded in their turn and fell, still holding in
their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.

0307m



Edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside
him. He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see
in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are
visible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless
with amazement.

Three compartments divided the coffer. In the first, blazed piles of
golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold, which
possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, Edmond
grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell
on one another, sounded like hail against glass.

After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed
through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock,
from whence he could behold the sea. He was aloneâ€”alone with these
countless, these unheard-of treasures! Was he awake, or was it but a
dream? Was it a transient vision, or was he face to face with reality?

He would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength
enough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent
his senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of
Monte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with
his wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to
believe the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found
himself before this mine of gold and jewels.

This time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively,
uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone. He soon became calmer and
more happy, for only now did he begin to realize his felicity.

He then set himself to work to count his fortune. There were a thousand
ingots of gold, each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled
up twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our
money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors;
and he saw that the complement was not half empty. And he measured ten
double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which,
mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their
intrinsic worth.

DantÃ¨s saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised
in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and a
small quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hoursâ€™
sleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.

It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous
emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.



 Chapter 25. The Unknown

Day, for which DantÃ¨s had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open
eyes, again dawned. With the first light DantÃ¨s resumed his search.
Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening,
and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but
it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the
morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of
eve.

Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets
with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could,
sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and
then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform
appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping
on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite,
filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted
rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn,
then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced
every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as
savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he
impatiently awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte
Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost
incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied
not the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among
mankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always
accorded to wealthâ€”that first and greatest of all the forces within the
grasp of man.

On the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance DantÃ¨s
recognized the rig and handling of _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_, and dragging
himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his
companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than
when they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late
accident. He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this
question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing
their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received
intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and
was crowding all sail towards them. This obliged them to make all the
speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the
absence of DantÃ¨s, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel
would have availed them so materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had
almost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled
them to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit.
Upon the whole, however, the trip had been sufficiently successful to
satisfy all concerned; while the crew, and particularly Jacopo,
expressed great regrets that DantÃ¨s had not been an equal sharer with
themselves in the profits, which amounted to no less a sum than fifty
piastres each.

0311m



Edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the
faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all
the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island;
but as _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_ had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him
away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to
Leghorn.

Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in
precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds
for five thousand francs each. DantÃ¨s half feared that such valuable
jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite
suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions
concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least
eighty per cent.

The following day DantÃ¨s presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel,
accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he
might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his
outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the
purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis DantÃ¨s, residing in
the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, and also a young woman called MercÃ©dÃ¨s, an
inhabitant of the Catalan village.

Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent
present, which DantÃ¨s hastened to account for by saying that he had
merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who
did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his
arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left
him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of
DantÃ¨s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that
it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy.

The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune
AmÃ©lie_ having expired, DantÃ¨s took leave of the captain, who at first
tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of
the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to
importune him further.

The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions
from DantÃ¨s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo.

Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, DantÃ¨s proceeded to make
his final adieus on board _La Jeune AmÃ©lie_, distributing so liberal a
gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all,
and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the
captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his
future plans. Then DantÃ¨s departed for Genoa.

At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay;
this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard
that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the
Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous
of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between
the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.
DantÃ¨s, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel,
applied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand
francs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate
possession. The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more
so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour
through Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks
or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to
complete another. A bargain was therefore struck. DantÃ¨s led the owner
of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a
few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew
counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in
bright gold pieces.

The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable
crew for the little vessel, but this DantÃ¨s declined with many thanks,
saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal
pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the
builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret
closet in the cabin at his bedâ€™s head, the closet to contain three
divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The
builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these
secret places completed by the next day, DantÃ¨s furnishing the
dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be
constructed.

0313m



Two hours afterward DantÃ¨s sailed from the port of Genoa, under the
inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the
rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their
wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with
which DantÃ¨s handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated
with almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest
touch; and DantÃ¨s required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to
acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high
reputation in the art of shipbuilding.

The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it
remained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable
destination. Some insisted she was making for Corsica, others the
Island of Elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for
Spain; while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her
intended course; but no one thought of Monte Cristo.

Yet thither it was that DantÃ¨s guided his vessel, and at Monte Cristo
he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself
a first-class sailor, and had come the distance from Genoa in
thirty-five hours. DantÃ¨s had carefully noted the general appearance of
the shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he dropped
anchor in the little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and bore
no evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was
just as he had left it.

Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches,
and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited
in the compartments of the secret locker.

A week passed by. DantÃ¨s employed it in manÅ“uvring his yacht round the
island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined
for some important service, till at the end of that time he was
perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former DantÃ¨s
proposed to augment, the latter to remedy.

Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail
approaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat
he had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was
returned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor
beside the yacht.

A mournful answer awaited each of Edmondâ€™s eager inquiries as to the
information Jacopo had obtained. Old DantÃ¨s was dead, and MercÃ©dÃ¨s had
disappeared.

DantÃ¨s listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but,
leaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite alone. In a
couple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopoâ€™s boat came on
board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she
should be steered direct to Marseilles. For his fatherâ€™s death he was
in some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the
mysterious disappearance of MercÃ©dÃ¨s.

Without divulging his secret, DantÃ¨s could not give sufficiently clear
instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was
desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could
investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had
assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of
recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he
thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the
little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and
anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the
never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, he
had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.

0315m



Still DantÃ¨s could not view without a shudder the approach of a
gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of
health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the
shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his
acquaintance with Faria, DantÃ¨s coolly presented an English passport he
had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a
French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there
existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.

The first person to attract the attention of DantÃ¨s, as he landed on
the CanebiÃ¨re, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_. Edmond
welcomed the meeting with this fellowâ€”who had been one of his own
sailorsâ€”as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time
had worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he
propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully
watching the manâ€™s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look
implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the
person with whom he was then conversing.

Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, DantÃ¨s
proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man
loudly calling him to stop.

DantÃ¨s instantly turned to meet him.

â€œI beg your pardon, sir,â€ said the honest fellow, in almost breathless
haste, â€œbut I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a
two-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.â€

â€œThank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake,
as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another
double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask
your messmates to join you.â€

So extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to
thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in
speechless astonishment. â€œSome nabob from India,â€ was his comment.

DantÃ¨s, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his
heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections
were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled
with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he
arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of
the AllÃ©es de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond
and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees
tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung
for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the
ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing
there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his
brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the
house in which his father had lived.

The nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to
train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the
house.

Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper
stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and
asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the
negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the
fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the
_concierge_ that they were occupied, DantÃ¨s succeeded in inducing the
man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be
allowed to look at them.

The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been
scarcely married a week; and seeing them, DantÃ¨s sighed heavily.
Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it
had been in the time of the elder DantÃ¨s; the very paper was different,
while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had
been filled in Edmondâ€™s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone
remained as he had left them.

The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former
owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of
his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as
he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last,
vainly calling for his son.

The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their
visitorâ€™s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing
each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they
felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning
him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to
indulge his sorrow alone.

0317m



When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both
accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come
again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling
would ever be open to him.

As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire
whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for
reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at
the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to
Beaucaire.

Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the
AllÃ©es de Meilhan belonged, DantÃ¨s next proceeded thither, and, under
the name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his
passport), purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five
thousand francs, at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had
its owner asked half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been
given.

The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of
the house, now become the property of DantÃ¨s, were duly informed by the
notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the
new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house,
without the least augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving
instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited.

This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the
neighborhood of the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, and a multitude of theories were
afloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth. But what raised
public astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance,
was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited
the AllÃ©es de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the
little village of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor
fishermanâ€™s hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after
persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or
sixteen years.

But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had
been asked received a handsome present, consisting of an entirely new
fishing-boat, with two seines and a tender.

The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have
poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen
him, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and
then springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte
dâ€™Aix.



 Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn

Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of
France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of
Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,â€”a little nearer to the former
than to the latter,â€”a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung,
creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a
grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of
entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed
upon the RhÃ´ne. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a
garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to
the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy
olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their
withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict.
Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes,
and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a
tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this
unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped
summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.

All these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which
the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others
being the Durance and the Parliament.

In the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid
ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no
doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the
country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those
parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a
grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene
with its strident, monotonous note.

For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man
and his wife, with two servants,â€”a chambermaid named Trinette, and a
hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the
requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had
revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and
the stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this
prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter
ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the RhÃ´ne from
which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a
hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful
description.

The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of
age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those
southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked
nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like
his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in
spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.
His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of
brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing
himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the
lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day,
exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other
protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it,
after the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old
acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.

His wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine
Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood
of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are
proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the
devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by
the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained
nearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or
stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his
daily watch at the doorâ€”a duty he performed with so much the greater
willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless
plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking
out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband
would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:

â€œHush, La Carconte. It is Godâ€™s pleasure that things should be so.â€

The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle
from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated
between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the
inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling
every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her
husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her
sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his
rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.

Still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to
the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under
the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers
and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partnerâ€™s
murmurs and lamentations.

0323m



Like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and
moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to
display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place
without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the
picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the
south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by
the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming
fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed
equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains,
necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests,
elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the
shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad
in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the
pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter
feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and
merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable
hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit
it afforded.

Caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the
door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven
grassâ€”on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly,
endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palateâ€”to
the deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was
aroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he
went, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the
entrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who
might be passing.

At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,
the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely
as a desert at midday. There it lay stretching out into one
interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall,
meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that
no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty
to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in
such a formidable Sahara.

Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes
longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching
from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he
would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse,
between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to
exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy
pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a
three-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the
pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.

Having arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether
for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to
say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his
steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure
him. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen
door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton
handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that
streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with
the end of his iron-shod stick.

At this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring
assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his
sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved
how little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy
footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the
upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the
Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.

0319m



â€œYou are welcome, sir, most welcome!â€ repeated the astonished
Caderousse. â€œNow, then, Margotin,â€ cried he, speaking to the dog, â€œwill
you be quiet? Pray donâ€™t heed him, sir!â€”he only barks, he never bites.
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this
dreadfully hot day.â€ Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the
traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: â€œA
thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to
receive under my poor roof. What would the abbÃ© please to have? What
refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.â€

The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
gazeâ€”there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the
countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at
his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he
deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said,
speaking with a strong Italian accent, â€œYou are, I presume, M.
Caderousse?â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ answered the host, even more surprised at the question than
he had been by the silence which had preceded it; â€œI am Gaspard
Caderousse, at your service.â€

â€œGaspard Caderousse,â€ rejoined the priest. â€œYes,â€”Christian and surname
are the same. You formerly lived, I believe in the AllÃ©es de Meilhan,
on the fourth floor?â€

0325m



â€œI did.â€

â€œAnd you followed the business of a tailor?â€

â€œTrue, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at
Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will
in time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there
nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?â€

â€œYes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your
permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.â€

â€œAs you please, sir,â€ said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the
present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of
Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in
the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor
and kitchen.

Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of
five minutes, he found the abbÃ© seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his
elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by
the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to
him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees,
his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed
earnestly on the travellerâ€™s face.

â€œAre you quite alone?â€ inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before
him the bottle of wine and a glass.

â€œQuite, quite alone,â€ replied the manâ€”â€œor, at least, practically so,
for my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself,
is laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance,
poor thing!â€

â€œYou are married, then?â€ said the priest, with a show of interest,
glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.

â€œAh, sir,â€ said Caderousse with a sigh, â€œit is easy to perceive I am
not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for
being honest.â€ The abbÃ© fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.

â€œYes, honestâ€”I can certainly say that much for myself,â€ continued the
innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbÃ©â€™s gaze; â€œI can
boast with truth of being an honest man; and,â€ continued he
significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, â€œthat is
more than everyone can say nowadays.â€

0327m



â€œSo much the better for you, if what you assert be true,â€ said the
abbÃ©; â€œfor I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will
be rewarded, and the wicked punished.â€

â€œSuch words as those belong to your profession,â€ answered Caderousse,
â€œand you do well to repeat them; but,â€ added he, with a bitter
expression of countenance, â€œone is free to believe them or not, as one
pleases.â€

â€œYou are wrong to speak thus,â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œand perhaps I may, in my
own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.â€

â€œWhat mean you?â€ inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.

â€œIn the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am
in search of.â€

â€œWhat proofs do you require?â€

â€œDid you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor
named DantÃ¨s?â€

â€œDantÃ¨s? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond DantÃ¨s and myself
were intimate friends!â€ exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed
darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbÃ© fixed on him,
while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with
feverish scrutiny.

â€œYou remind me,â€ said the priest, â€œthat the young man concerning whom I
asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.â€

â€œSaid to bear the name!â€ repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and
eager. â€œWhy, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation
of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor
Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous
and happy?â€

â€œHe died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the
felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.â€

A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse,
who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes
with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.

â€œPoor fellow, poor fellow!â€ murmured Caderousse. â€œWell, there, sir, is
another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and
that none but the wicked prosper. Ah,â€ continued Caderousse, speaking
in the highly colored language of the South, â€œthe world grows worse and
worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said
to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?â€

â€œYou speak as though you had loved this young DantÃ¨s,â€ observed the
abbÃ©, without taking any notice of his companionâ€™s vehemence.

â€œAnd so I did,â€ replied Caderousse; â€œthough once, I confess, I envied
him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by
everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely
lamented his unhappy fate.â€

There was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the
abbÃ© was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the
innkeeper.

â€œYou knew the poor lad, then?â€ continued Caderousse.

â€œI was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to
him the consolations of religion.â€

â€œAnd of what did he die?â€ asked Caderousse in a choking voice.

â€œOf what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they
have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of
imprisonment?â€ Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration
that gathered on his brow.

0329m



â€œBut the strangest part of the story is,â€ resumed the abbÃ©, â€œthat
DantÃ¨s, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer,
that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.â€

â€œAnd so he was,â€ murmured Caderousse. â€œHow should he have been
otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.â€

â€œAnd for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he
had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any
foul spot or stain have fallen on it.â€

And here the look of the abbÃ©, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to
rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was
rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.

â€œA rich Englishman,â€ continued the abbÃ©, â€œwho had been his companion in
misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second
restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he
bestowed on DantÃ¨s upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his
gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which DantÃ¨s had
nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,
who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,
DantÃ¨s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of
prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a
diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.â€

â€œThen, I suppose,â€ asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, â€œthat
it was a stone of immense value?â€

â€œWhy, everything is relative,â€ answered the abbÃ©. â€œTo one in Edmondâ€™s
position the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at
fifty thousand francs.â€

â€œBless me!â€ exclaimed Caderousse, â€œfifty thousand francs! Surely the
diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.â€

â€œNo,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œit was not of such a size as that; but you
shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.â€

The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the
priestâ€™s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the
treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with
black shagreen, the abbÃ© opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes
of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of
admirable workmanship.

â€œAnd that diamond,â€ cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager
admiration, â€œyou say, is worth fifty thousand francs?â€

â€œIt is, without the setting, which is also valuable,â€ replied the abbÃ©,
as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its
brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated
innkeeper.

â€œBut how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make you
his heir?â€

â€œNo, merely his testamentary executor. â€˜I once possessed four dear and
faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothedâ€™ he said;
â€˜and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.
The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.â€™â€ The innkeeper
shivered.

â€œâ€˜Another of the number,â€™â€ continued the abbÃ©, without seeming to
notice the emotion of Caderousse, â€œâ€˜is called Danglars; and the third,
in spite of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for
me.â€™â€

A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about
to break in upon the abbÃ©â€™s speech, when the latter, waving his hand,
said, â€œAllow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations
to make, you can do so afterwards. â€˜The third of my friends, although
my rival, was much attached to me,â€”his name was Fernand; that of my
betrothed wasâ€™â€”Stay, stay,â€ continued the abbÃ©, â€œI have forgotten what
he called her.â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s,â€ said Caderousse eagerly.

â€œTrue,â€ said the abbÃ©, with a stifled sigh, â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s it was.â€

â€œGo on,â€ urged Caderousse.

â€œBring me a _carafe_ of water,â€ said the abbÃ©.

Caderousse quickly performed the strangerâ€™s bidding; and after pouring
some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbÃ©,
resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty
glass on the table:

â€œWhere did we leave off?â€

â€œThe name of Edmondâ€™s betrothed was MercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œTo be sure. â€˜You will go to Marseilles,â€™ said DantÃ¨s,â€”for you
understand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them. Do you
understand?â€

â€œPerfectly.â€

â€œâ€˜You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal
parts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only
persons who have loved me upon earth.â€™â€

â€œBut why into five parts?â€ asked Caderousse; â€œyou only mentioned four
persons.â€

â€œBecause the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmondâ€™s
bequest, was his own father.â€

â€œToo true, too true!â€ ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the
contending passions which assailed him, â€œthe poor old man did die.â€

â€œI learned so much at Marseilles,â€ replied the abbÃ©, making a strong
effort to appear indifferent; â€œbut from the length of time that has
elapsed since the death of the elder DantÃ¨s, I was unable to obtain any
particulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?â€

â€œI do not know who could if I could not,â€ said Caderousse. â€œWhy, I
lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah, yes, about a
year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died.â€

â€œOf what did he die?â€

â€œWhy, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe; his
acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying
moments, I say he died ofâ€”â€”â€

Caderousse paused.

â€œOf what?â€ asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.

â€œWhy, of downright starvation.â€

â€œStarvation!â€ exclaimed the abbÃ©, springing from his seat. â€œWhy, the
vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. The
very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some
pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a
Christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other
men who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it
is impossible!â€”utterly impossible!â€

â€œWhat I have said, I have said,â€ answered Caderousse.

â€œAnd you are a fool for having said anything about it,â€ said a voice
from the top of the stairs. â€œWhy should you meddle with what does not
concern you?â€

The two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La
Carconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of
voices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on
the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing
conversation.

â€œMind your own business, wife,â€ replied Caderousse sharply. â€œThis
gentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not
permit me to refuse.â€

â€œPoliteness, you simpleton!â€ retorted La Carconte. â€œWhat have you to do
with politeness, I should like to know? Better study a little common
prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying
to extract all he can from you?â€

â€œI pledge you my word, madam,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œthat my intentions are
good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me
candidly.â€

â€œAh, thatâ€™s all very fine,â€ retorted the woman. â€œNothing is easier than
to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when
poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell
all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly
forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold
trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the
unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions
come.â€

â€œNay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you.
Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my
instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.â€

La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again
drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two
speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to
hear every word they uttered. Again the abbÃ© had been obliged to
swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to
overpower him.

When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, â€œIt appears, then,
that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by
everyone. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have
perished by so dreadful a death.â€

â€œWhy, he was not altogether forsaken,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œfor
MercÃ©dÃ¨s the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him; but
somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for
Fernandâ€”the very person,â€ added Caderousse with a bitter smile, â€œthat
you named just now as being one of DantÃ¨sâ€™ faithful and attached
friends.â€

â€œAnd was he not so?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œGaspard, Gaspard!â€ murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,
â€œmind what you are saying!â€

Caderousse made no reply to these words, though evidently irritated and
annoyed by the interruption, but, addressing the abbÃ©, said, â€œCan a man
be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself?
But DantÃ¨s was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he
believed everybodyâ€™s professions of friendship. Poor Edmond, he was
cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might
have found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his
enemies. And, whatever people may say,â€ continued Caderousse, in his
native language, which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, â€œI
cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the
dead than the hatred of the living.â€

â€œImbecile!â€ exclaimed La Carconte.

â€œDo you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured DantÃ¨s?â€ inquired
the abbÃ© of Caderousse.

â€œDo I? No one better.â€

â€œSpeak out then, say what it was!â€

â€œGaspard!â€ cried La Carconte, â€œdo as you will; you are masterâ€”but if
you take my advice youâ€™ll hold your tongue.â€

â€œWell, wife,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œI donâ€™t know but what youâ€™re right!â€

â€œSo you will say nothing?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œWhy, what good would it do?â€ asked Caderousse. â€œIf the poor lad were
living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were
his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not
hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing
to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with
him.â€

â€œYou prefer, then,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œthat I should bestow on men you say
are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful
friendship?â€

â€œThat is true enough,â€ returned Caderousse. â€œYou say truly, the gift of
poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars;
besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the
ocean.â€

â€œRemember,â€ chimed in La Carconte, â€œthose two could crush you at a
single blow!â€

â€œHow so?â€ inquired the abbÃ©. â€œAre these persons, then, so rich and
powerful?â€

â€œDo you not know their history?â€

â€œI do not. Pray relate it to me!â€

Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, â€œNo, truly,
it would take up too much time.â€

â€œWell, my good friend,â€ returned the abbÃ©, in a tone that indicated
utter indifference on his part, â€œyou are at liberty, either to speak or
be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples
and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty
as conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My
first business will be to dispose of this diamond.â€

So saying, the abbÃ© again drew the small box from his pocket, opened
it, and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of
brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.

â€œWife, wife!â€ cried he in a hoarse voice, â€œcome here!â€

â€œDiamond!â€ exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber
with a tolerably firm step; â€œwhat diamond are you talking about?â€

â€œWhy, did you not hear all we said?â€ inquired Caderousse. â€œIt is a
beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond DantÃ¨s, to be sold, and the money
divided between his father, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, his betrothed bride, Fernand,
Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand
francs.â€

â€œOh, what a magnificent jewel!â€ cried the astonished woman.

â€œThe fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does
it not?â€ asked Caderousse.

â€œIt does,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œwith the addition of an equal division of
that part intended for the elder DantÃ¨s, which I believe myself at
liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.â€

â€œAnd why among us four?â€ inquired Caderousse.

â€œAs being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to
him.â€

â€œI donâ€™t call those friends who betray and ruin you,â€ murmured the wife
in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.

â€œOf course not!â€ rejoined Caderousse quickly; â€œno more do I, and that
was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked
upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps
crime.â€

â€œRemember,â€ answered the abbÃ© calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its
case in the pocket of his cassock, â€œit is your fault, not mine, that I
do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of
both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmondâ€™s last
wishes.â€

The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of
perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbÃ© rise from
his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse
were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his
wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.

0335m



â€œThere, you see, wife,â€ said the former, â€œthis splendid diamond might
all be ours, if we chose!â€

â€œDo you believe it?â€

â€œWhy, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!â€

â€œWell,â€ replied La Carconte, â€œdo as you like. For my part, I wash my
hands of the affair.â€

So saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber,
her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in
spite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she
turned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband,
â€œGaspard, consider well what you are about to do!â€

â€œI have both reflected and decided,â€ answered he.

La Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked
beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her
armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.

â€œWell,â€ asked the abbÃ©, as he returned to the apartment below, â€œwhat
have you made up your mind to do?â€

â€œTo tell you all I know,â€ was the reply.

â€œI certainly think you act wisely in so doing,â€ said the priest. â€œNot
because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to
conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could
distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so
much the better, that is all.â€

â€œI hope it may be so,â€ replied Caderousse, his face flushed with
cupidity.

â€œI am all attention,â€ said the abbÃ©.

â€œStop a minute,â€ answered Caderousse; â€œwe might be interrupted in the
most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as
well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.â€

With these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,
by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was
accustomed to do at night.

During this time the abbÃ© had chosen his place for listening at his
ease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself
would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the
narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather
clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to
Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to
him.

â€œRemember, this is no affair of mine,â€ said the trembling voice of La
Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the
scene that was enacting below.

â€œEnough, enough!â€ replied Caderousse; â€œsay no more about it; I will
take all the consequences upon myself.â€

And he began his story.



 Chapter 27. The Story

First, sir,â€ said Caderousse, â€œyou must make me a promise.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œWhy, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that
you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for the
persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they
only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces
like glass.â€

â€œMake yourself easy, my friend,â€ replied the abbÃ©. â€œI am a priest, and
confessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry
out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then,
without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I
do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to
speak; besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to
God, and not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I
have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.â€

This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.

â€œWell, then, under these circumstances,â€ said Caderousse, â€œI will, I
even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor
Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.â€

â€œBegin with his father, if you please.â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œEdmond talked
to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.â€

â€œThe history is a sad one, sir,â€ said Caderousse, shaking his head;
â€œperhaps you know all the earlier part of it?â€

â€œYes.â€ answered the abbÃ©; â€œEdmond related to me everything until the
moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.â€

â€œAt La RÃ©serve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.â€

â€œWas it not his betrothal feast?â€

â€œIt was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending;
a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and DantÃ¨s was
arrested.â€

â€œYes, and up to this point I know all,â€ said the priest. â€œDantÃ¨s
himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never
beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of
anyone of them.â€

â€œWell, when DantÃ¨s was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the
particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his
home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up
and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for
I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for
myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the
poor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my
heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.

â€œThe next day MercÃ©dÃ¨s came to implore the protection of M. de
Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old
man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a
sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she
wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old
man would not consent. â€˜No,â€™ was the old manâ€™s reply, â€˜I will not leave
this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the
world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first
thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?â€™ I heard
all this from the window, for I was anxious that MercÃ©dÃ¨s should
persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head
night and day did not leave me a momentâ€™s repose.â€

â€œBut did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?â€
asked the abbÃ©.

â€œAh, sir,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œwe cannot console those who will not be
consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he
seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and
I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his
door he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you,
sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it
was more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter,
and hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, â€˜It is really well, and I am
very glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt
such excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory
or heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at
once, for I could not bear it.â€™â€

â€œPoor father!â€ murmured the priest.

â€œFrom day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.
Morrel and MercÃ©dÃ¨s came to see him, but his door was closed; and,
although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer.
One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted MercÃ©dÃ¨s, and
the poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to
console him, he said to her,â€”â€˜Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead;
and instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite
happy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.â€™

â€œHowever well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after
a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and
so at last old DantÃ¨s was left all to himself, and I only saw from time
to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle
they tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he
sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the
poor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quartersâ€™
rent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week,
which was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into
my apartment when he left his.

â€œFor the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on
the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all
risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw
him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told
M. Morrel and then ran on to MercÃ©dÃ¨s. They both came immediately, M.
Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of
the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I
never shall forget the old manâ€™s smile at this prescription.

â€œFrom that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not
eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.â€

The abbÃ© uttered a kind of groan.

â€œThe story interests you, does it not, sir?â€ inquired Caderousse.

â€œYes,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œit is very affecting.â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s came again, and she found him so altered that she was even
more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.
Morrelâ€™s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against
his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were
actually frightened. MercÃ©dÃ¨s remained, therefore, by his bedside, and
M. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his
purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctorâ€™s
order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine
days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had
caused his misery, and saying to MercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€˜If you ever see my Edmond
again, tell him I die blessing him.â€™â€

The abbÃ© rose from his chair, made two turns round the chamber, and
pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat.

â€œAnd you believe he diedâ€”â€”â€

â€œOf hunger, sir, of hunger,â€ said Caderousse. â€œI am as certain of it as
that we two are Christians.â€

The abbÃ©, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was
standing by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed
his seat, with red eyes and pale cheeks.

â€œThis was, indeed, a horrid event,â€ said he in a hoarse voice.

â€œThe more so, sir, as it was menâ€™s and not Godâ€™s doing.â€

â€œTell me of those men,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œand remember too,â€ he added in
an almost menacing tone, â€œyou have promised to tell me everything. Tell
me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and
the father with famine?â€

â€œTwo men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from
ambition,â€”Fernand and Danglars.â€

â€œHow was this jealousy manifested? Speak on.â€

â€œThey denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.â€

â€œWhich of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?â€

â€œBoth, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.â€

â€œAnd where was this letter written?â€

â€œAt La RÃ©serve, the day before the betrothal feast.â€

â€œâ€™Twas so, thenâ€”â€™twas so, then,â€ murmured the abbÃ©. â€œOh, Faria, Faria,
how well did you judge men and things!â€

â€œWhat did you please to say, sir?â€ asked Caderousse.

â€œNothing, nothing,â€ replied the priest; â€œgo on.â€

â€œIt was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that
his writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the
post.â€

â€œBut,â€ exclaimed the abbÃ© suddenly, â€œyou were there yourself.â€

â€œI!â€ said Caderousse, astonished; â€œwho told you I was there?â€

The abbÃ© saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,â€”â€œNo one;
but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an
eye-witness.â€

â€œTrue, true!â€ said Caderousse in a choking voice, â€œI was there.â€

â€œAnd did you not remonstrate against such infamy?â€ asked the abbÃ©; â€œif
not, you were an accomplice.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œthey had made me drink to such an excess
that I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct
understanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in
such a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest
they were carrying on, and perfectly harmless.â€

â€œNext dayâ€”next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had
been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when DantÃ¨s
was arrested.â€

â€œYes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars
restrained me. â€˜If he should really be guilty,â€™ said he, â€˜and did
really put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a
letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this
letter upon him, those who have supported him will pass for his
accomplices.â€™ I confess I had my fears, in the state in which politics
then were, and I held my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but it was
not criminal.â€

0341m



â€œI understandâ€”you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ answered Caderousse; â€œand remorse preys on me night and
day. I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action,
the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my
life, is no doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a
moment of selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she
complains, â€˜Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.â€™â€ And
Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance.

â€œWell, sir,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œyou have spoken unreservedly; and thus to
accuse yourself is to deserve pardon.â€

â€œUnfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.â€

â€œHe did not know,â€ said the abbÃ©.

â€œBut he knows it all now,â€ interrupted Caderousse; â€œthey say the dead
know everything.â€

There was a brief silence; the abbÃ© rose and paced up and down
pensively, and then resumed his seat.

â€œYou have two or three times mentioned a M. Morrel,â€ he said; â€œwho was
he?â€

â€œThe owner of the _Pharaon_ and patron of DantÃ¨s.â€

â€œAnd what part did he play in this sad drama?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œThe part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty
times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,
implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second
restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told
you, he came to see DantÃ¨sâ€™ father, and offered to receive him in his
own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already
said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the
old manâ€™s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmondâ€™s father died,
as he had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still
by meâ€”a large one, made of red silk.â€

â€œAnd,â€ asked the abbÃ©, â€œis M. Morrel still alive?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Caderousse.

â€œIn that case,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œhe should be a man blessed of God,
rich, happy.â€

Caderousse smiled bitterly. â€œYes, happy as myself,â€ said he.

â€œWhat! M. Morrel unhappy?â€ exclaimed the abbÃ©.

â€œHe is reduced almost to the last extremityâ€”nay, he is almost at the
point of dishonor.â€

â€œHow?â€

â€œYes,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œso it is; after five-and-twenty years of
labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of
Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two
years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his
only hope now is in that very _Pharaon_ which poor DantÃ¨s commanded,
and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and
indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.â€

â€œAnd has the unfortunate man wife or children?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œYes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel;
he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose
family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he
has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,
all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were
alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an
end.â€

â€œHorrible!â€ ejaculated the priest.

â€œAnd it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,â€ added Caderousse. â€œYou
see, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you ofâ€”am in
destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and
I unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as
old DantÃ¨s did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth.â€

â€œHow is that?â€

â€œBecause their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men
have been reduced to misery.â€

â€œWhat has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most
guilty?â€

â€œWhat has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the
recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier
into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the
commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that
money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his
capital; and, having first married his bankerâ€™s daughter, who left him
a widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne,
daughter of M. de Servieux, the kingâ€™s chamberlain, who is in high
favor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron,
and now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du
Mont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his
antechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.â€

â€œAh!â€ said the abbÃ©, in a peculiar tone, â€œhe is happy.â€

â€œHappy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret
known but to oneâ€™s self and the wallsâ€”walls have ears but no tongue;
but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.â€

â€œAnd Fernand?â€

â€œFernand? Why, much the same story.â€

â€œBut how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or
resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.â€

â€œAnd it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some
strange secret that no one knows.â€

â€œBut, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or
high position?â€

â€œBoth, sirâ€”he has both fortune and positionâ€”both.â€

â€œThis must be impossible!â€

â€œIt would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days
before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons
left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a
special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too;
but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I
was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army,
went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny.
The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who
carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the
general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to
accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed
the general.

â€œFernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on
the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to
France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the
general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a
captain in 1823, during the Spanish warâ€”that is to say, at the time
when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and
being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,
found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the
support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received
promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths
known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by
the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief
campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and
received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion
of Honor.â€

â€œDestiny! destiny!â€ murmured the abbÃ©.

â€œYes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,
Fernandâ€™s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to
endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had
begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athensâ€”it
was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,
without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to
volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve
in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.

0345m



Some time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the
name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of
instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he
died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a
considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was
gazetted lieutenant-general.â€

â€œSo that nowâ€”â€”?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œSo that now,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œhe owns a magnificent houseâ€”No.
27, Rue du Helder, Paris.â€

The abbÃ© opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an
effort at self-control, he said, â€œAnd MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€”they tell me that she
has disappeared?â€

â€œDisappeared,â€ said Caderousse, â€œyes, as the sun disappears, to rise
the next day with still more splendor.â€

â€œHas she made a fortune also?â€ inquired the abbÃ©, with an ironical
smile.

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,â€
replied Caderousse.

â€œGo on,â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œit seems as if I were listening to the story
of a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell
me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.â€

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which
deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate
M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder DantÃ¨s. In the midst of her
despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of
Fernandâ€”of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded
as her brother. Fernand went, and MercÃ©dÃ¨s remained alone.

â€œThree months passed and still she weptâ€”no news of Edmond, no news of
Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with
despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of
two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her
home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew,
turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the
uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.

â€œIt was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of
her past life had returned to her.

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s seized Fernandâ€™s hands with a transport which he took for
love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and
seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then,
it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hatedâ€”he was only not
precisely loved. Another possessed all MercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™ heart; that other was
absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought
MercÃ©dÃ¨s burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but
the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested
to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too,
old DantÃ¨s incessantly said to her, â€˜Our Edmond is dead; if he were
not, he would return to us.â€™

â€œThe old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, MercÃ©dÃ¨s,
perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been
there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned
of the old manâ€™s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his
first coming he had not said a word of love to MercÃ©dÃ¨s; at the second
he reminded her that he loved her.

â€œMercÃ©dÃ¨s begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for
Edmond.â€

â€œSo that,â€ said the abbÃ©, with a bitter smile, â€œthat makes eighteen
months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?â€ Then he
murmured the words of the English poet, â€œâ€˜Frailty, thy name is woman.â€™â€

â€œSix months afterwards,â€ continued Caderousse, â€œthe marriage took place
in the church of Accoules.â€

â€œThe very church in which she was to have married Edmond,â€ murmured the
priest; â€œthere was only a change of bridegrooms.â€

â€œWell, MercÃ©dÃ¨s was married,â€ proceeded Caderousse; â€œbut although in
the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she
passed La RÃ©serve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had
been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had
she looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not
more at his easeâ€”for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of
Edmondâ€™s returnâ€”Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to
depart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated
with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left
Marseilles.â€

â€œDid you ever see MercÃ©dÃ¨s again?â€ inquired the priest.

â€œYes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;
she was attending to the education of her son.â€

The abbÃ© started. â€œHer son?â€ said he.

â€œYes,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œlittle Albert.â€

â€œBut, then, to be able to instruct her child,â€ continued the abbÃ©, â€œshe
must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that
she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.â€

â€œOh,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œdid he know so little of his lovely
betrothed? MercÃ©dÃ¨s might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to
be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernandâ€™s
fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing
fortune. She learned drawing, musicâ€”everything. Besides, I believe,
between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she
might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the
weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,â€
continued Caderousse; â€œno doubt fortune and honors have comforted her;
she is rich, a countess, and yetâ€”â€”â€

Caderousse paused.

â€œAnd yet what?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œYet, I am sure, she is not happy,â€ said Caderousse.

â€œWhat makes you believe this?â€

â€œWhy, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old friends
would, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not even
receive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his
valet-de-chambre.â€

â€œThen you did not see either of them?â€

â€œNo, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.â€

â€œHow was that?â€

â€œAs I went away a purse fell at my feetâ€”it contained five-and-twenty
louis; I raised my head quickly, and saw MercÃ©dÃ¨s, who at once shut the
blind.â€

â€œAnd M. de Villefort?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œOh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had
nothing to ask of him.â€

â€œDo you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmondâ€™s
misfortunes?â€

â€œNo; I only know that some time after Edmondâ€™s arrest, he married
Mademoiselle de Saint-MÃ©ran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt
he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars,
as high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor,
wretched, and forgotten.â€

â€œYou are mistaken, my friend,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œGod may seem
sometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there
always comes a moment when he remembersâ€”and beholdâ€”a proof!â€

As he spoke, the abbÃ© took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it
to Caderousse, said, â€œHere, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.â€

â€œWhat, for me only?â€ cried Caderousse, â€œah, sir, do not jest with me!â€

â€œThis diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one
friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and
sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that
this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.â€

0351m



â€œOh, sir,â€ said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the
other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,â€”â€œOh, sir, do
not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.â€

â€œI know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of
such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchangeâ€”â€”â€

Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.

The abbÃ© smiled.

â€œIn exchange,â€ he continued, â€œgive me the red silk purse that M. Morrel
left on old DantÃ¨sâ€™ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in
your hands.â€

Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken
cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbÃ© a long purse of faded red silk,
round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abbÃ©
took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.

â€œOh, you are a man of God, sir,â€ cried Caderousse; â€œfor no one knew
that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.â€

â€œWhich,â€ said the abbÃ© to himself, â€œyou would have done.â€ The abbÃ©
rose, took his hat and gloves. â€œWell,â€ he said, â€œall you have told me
is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.â€

â€œSee, sir,â€ replied Caderousse, â€œin this corner is a crucifix in holy
woodâ€”here on this shelf is my wifeâ€™s testament; open this book, and I
will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by
my soulâ€™s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to
you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear
of God at the day of the last judgment!â€

â€œâ€™Tis well,â€ said the abbÃ©, convinced by his manner and tone that
Caderousse spoke the truth. â€œâ€™Tis well, and may this money profit you!
Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.â€

The abbÃ© with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of
Caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse,
once more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells,
and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming.

When Caderousse turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and
trembling more than ever.

â€œIs, then, all that I have heard really true?â€ she inquired.

â€œWhat? That he has given the diamond to us only?â€ inquired Caderousse,
half bewildered with joy; â€œyes, nothing more true! See, here it is.â€

The woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice,
â€œSuppose itâ€™s false?â€

Caderousse started and turned pale.

â€œFalse!â€ he muttered. â€œFalse! Why should that man give me a false
diamond?â€

0349m



â€œTo get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!â€

Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an
idea.

â€œOh!â€ he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red
handkerchief tied round his head, â€œwe will soon find out.â€

â€œIn what way?â€

â€œWhy, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from
Paris there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife,
and I shall be back in two hours,â€ and Caderousse left the house in
haste, and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the
priest had taken.

â€œFifty thousand francs!â€ muttered La Carconte when left alone; â€œit is a
large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.â€

 Chapter 28. The Prison Register

The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken
place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about
thirty or two-and-thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen
trousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an
Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles.

â€œSir,â€ said he, â€œI am chief clerk of the house of Thomson & French, of
Rome. We are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house
of Morrel & Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or
thereabouts loaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at
reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I
have come, therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied the mayor. â€œI know very well that during the last four
or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He has lost
four or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but
it is not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten
thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his
finances. Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I
shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up
to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.
This is all I can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself
to M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles;
he has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrelâ€™s hands, and
if there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount
than mine, you will most probably find him better informed than
myself.â€

The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow
and went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards
the street mentioned.

M. de Boville was in his private room, and the Englishman, on
perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to indicate
that it was not the first time he had been in his presence. As to M. de
Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all the
faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at
the moment, did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray
to the past.

The Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him in terms
nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of
Marseilles.

â€œOh, sir,â€ exclaimed M. de Boville, â€œyour fears are unfortunately but
too well founded, and you see before you a man in despair. I had two
hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two
hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be
married in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were
payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th
of next month. I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these
payments punctually, and he has been here within the last half-hour to
tell me that if his ship, the _Pharaon_, did not come into port on the
15th, he would be wholly unable to make this payment.â€

â€œBut,â€ said the Englishman, â€œthis looks very much like a suspension of
payment.â€

â€œIt looks more like bankruptcy!â€ exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.

The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, â€œFrom which
it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable
apprehension?â€

â€œTo tell you the truth, I consider it lost.â€

â€œWell, then, I will buy it of you!â€

â€œYou?â€

â€œYes, I!â€

â€œBut at a tremendous discount, of course?â€

â€œNo, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house,â€ added the Englishman
with a laugh, â€œdoes not do things in that way.â€

â€œAnd you will payâ€”â€”â€

â€œReady money.â€

20023m



And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes, which
might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared to lose. A ray of
joy passed across M. de Bovilleâ€™s countenance, yet he made an effort at
self-control, and said:

â€œSir, I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not
realize six per cent of this sum.â€

â€œThatâ€™s no affair of mine,â€ replied the Englishman, â€œthat is the affair
of the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act. They have,
perhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm.
But all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in
exchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a brokerage.â€

â€œOf course, that is perfectly just,â€ cried M. de Boville. â€œThe
commission is usually one and a half; will you have twoâ€”threeâ€”five per
cent, or even more? Whatever you say.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied the Englishman, laughing, â€œI am like my house, and do
not do such thingsâ€”no, the commission I ask is quite different.â€

â€œName it, sir, I beg.â€

â€œYou are the inspector of prisons?â€

â€œI have been so these fourteen years.â€

â€œYou keep the registers of entries and departures?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œTo these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?â€

â€œThere are special reports on every prisoner.â€

â€œWell, sir, I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbÃ©, who
disappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the
ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his
death.â€

â€œWhat was his name?â€

â€œThe AbbÃ© Faria.â€

â€œOh, I recollect him perfectly,â€ cried M. de Boville; â€œhe was crazy.â€

â€œSo they said.â€

â€œOh, he was, decidedly.â€

â€œVery possibly; but what sort of madness was it?â€

â€œHe pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to
the government if they would liberate him.â€

â€œPoor devil!â€”and he is dead?â€

â€œYes, sir, five or six months ago, last February.â€

â€œYou have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.â€

â€œI recollect this, because the poor devilâ€™s death was accompanied by a
singular incident.â€

â€œMay I ask what that was?â€ said the Englishman with an expression of
curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at
discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.

â€œOh dear, yes, sir; the abbÃ©â€™s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant
from that of one of Bonaparteâ€™s emissaries,â€”one of those who had
contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very
resolute and very dangerous man.â€

â€œIndeed!â€ said the Englishman.

â€œYes,â€ replied M. de Boville; â€œI myself had occasion to see this man in
1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of
soldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget
his countenance!â€

20025m



The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.

â€œAnd you say, sir,â€ he interposed, â€œthat the two dungeonsâ€”â€”â€

â€œWere separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this
Edmond DantÃ¨sâ€”â€”â€

â€œThis dangerous manâ€™s name wasâ€”â€”â€

â€œEdmond DantÃ¨s. It appears, sir, that this Edmond DantÃ¨s had procured
tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the
prisoners held communication with one another.â€

â€œThis tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?â€

â€œNo doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the AbbÃ© Faria had an
attack of catalepsy, and died.â€

â€œThat must have cut short the projects of escape.â€

â€œFor the dead man, yes,â€ replied M. de Boville, â€œbut not for the
survivor; on the contrary, this DantÃ¨s saw a means of accelerating his
escape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the ChÃ¢teau
dâ€™If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the
dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they
had sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.â€

â€œIt was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,â€ remarked the
Englishman.

â€œAs I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,
fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears
it had on his account.â€

â€œHow was that?â€

â€œHow? Do you not comprehend?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œThe ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into
the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.â€

â€œWell?â€ observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.

â€œWell, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him
into the sea.â€

â€œReally!â€ exclaimed the Englishman.

â€œYes, sir,â€ continued the inspector of prisons. â€œYou may imagine the
amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the
rocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.â€

â€œThat would have been difficult.â€

â€œNo matter,â€ replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty
of recovering his two hundred thousand francs,â€”â€œno matter, I can fancy
it.â€ And he shouted with laughter.

â€œSo can I,â€ said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as
the English do, â€œat the end of his teeth.â€

â€œAnd so,â€ continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, â€œhe
was drowned?â€

â€œUnquestionably.â€

â€œSo that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner
at the same time?â€

â€œPrecisely.â€

20027m



â€œBut some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?â€
inquired the Englishman.

â€œYes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, DantÃ¨sâ€™ relations,
if he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or
alive.â€

â€œSo that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do
so with easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it.â€

â€œOh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.â€

â€œSo be it,â€ said the Englishman. â€œBut to return to these registers.â€

â€œTrue, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me.â€

â€œExcuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to me
very curious.â€

â€œYes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbÃ©,
who really was gentleness itself.â€

â€œYes, you will much oblige me.â€

â€œGo into my study here, and I will show it to you.â€

And they both entered M. de Bovilleâ€™s study. Everything was here
arranged in perfect order; each register had its number, each file of
papers its place. The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself
in an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents
relative to the ChÃ¢teau dâ€™If, giving him all the time he desired for
the examination, while De Boville seated himself in a corner, and began
to read his newspaper. The Englishman easily found the entries relative
to the AbbÃ© Faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector
had related interested him greatly, for after having perused the first
documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition
respecting Edmond DantÃ¨s. There he found everything arranged in due
order,â€”the accusation, examination, Morrelâ€™s petition, M. de
Villefortâ€™s marginal notes. He folded up the accusation quietly, and
put it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the
name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application
dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureurâ€™s
advice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on
the throne) the services DantÃ¨s had rendered to the imperial
causeâ€”services which Villefortâ€™s certificates rendered indisputable.
Then he saw through the whole thing. This petition to Napoleon, kept
back by Villefort, had become, under the second restoration, a terrible
weapon against him in the hands of the kingâ€™s attorney. He was no
longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this
note, placed in a bracket against his name:

Edmond DantÃ¨s.

An inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the
Island of Elba.

To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched
and guarded.

Beneath these lines was written in another hand: â€œSee note
aboveâ€”nothing can be done.â€

He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the
certificate placed beneath Morrelâ€™s petition, and discovered that the
note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificateâ€”that is to
say, was in Villefortâ€™s handwriting.

20029m



As to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that
it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary
interest in DantÃ¨sâ€™ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have
quoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had
felt.

As we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not
disturb the AbbÃ© Fariaâ€™s pupil in his researches, had seated himself in
a corner, and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc_. He did not see the
Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by
Danglars under the arbor of La RÃ©serve, and which had the postmark,
â€œMarseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 oâ€™clock, P.M.â€

But it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little
importance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two
hundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the
Englishman might do, however irregular it might be.

â€œThanks,â€ said the latter, closing the register with a slam, â€œI have
all I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me a simple
assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash,
and I will hand you over the money.â€

He rose, gave his seat to M. de Boville, who took it without ceremony,
and quickly drew up the required assignment, while the Englishman
counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk.



 Chapter 29. The House of Morrel & Son

Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well
acquainted with the interior of Morrelâ€™s warehouse, and had returned at
this date, would have found a great change. Instead of that air of
life, of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and
prosperous business establishmentâ€”instead of merry faces at the
windows, busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsâ€”instead
of the court filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and
the jokes of porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect
of sadness and gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill
the deserted corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a
young man of three or four-and-twenty, who was in love with M. Morrelâ€™s
daughter, and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his
friends to induce him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed
cashier, called â€œCocles,â€ or â€œCock-eye,â€ a nickname given him by the
young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive,
and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not,
in all probability, have replied to anyone who addressed him by it.

Cocles remained in M. Morrelâ€™s service, and a most singular change had
taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank
of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the
same Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of
arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against
the world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the
multiplication-table, which he had at his fingersâ€™ ends, no matter what
scheme or what trap was laid to catch him.

In the midst of the disasters that befell the house, Cocles was the
only one unmoved. But this did not arise from a want of affection; on
the contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the rats that one by one
forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor, so all
the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the
warehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the
cause of their departure. Everything was as we have said, a question of
arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all
payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him
that the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the
river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.

Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Coclesâ€™ belief; the last monthâ€™s
payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had
detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same
evening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,
threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying:

â€œThanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.â€

Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,
himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more
than a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M.
Morrel had passed many an anxious hour.

In order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his
resources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get
bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an
extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wifeâ€™s and
daughterâ€™s jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means the end of
the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted. Credit,
owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the
one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month, and
the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M.
de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the
_Pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had
weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in
harbor.

But this vessel which, like the _Pharaon_, came from Calcutta, had been
in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the
_Pharaon_.

20033m



Such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.
de Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of
Rome, presented himself at M. Morrelâ€™s.

Emmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of
every new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor,
come in anxiety to question the head of the house. The young man,
wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned
the new-comer; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to
M. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M. Morrel in person.

Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared, and the young
man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrelâ€™s apartment. Cocles went
first, and the stranger followed him. On the staircase they met a
beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked with anxiety at the
stranger.

â€œM. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?â€ said the
cashier.

â€œYes; I think so, at least,â€ said the young girl hesitatingly. â€œGo and
see, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman.â€

â€œIt will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,â€ returned the
Englishman. â€œM. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has
only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &
French of Rome, with whom your father does business.â€

The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger
and Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office
where Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,
opened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,
conducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which
he closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of
Thomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.

The Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning
over the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of
his liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the
ledger, arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen
him seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the
worthy merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this
history, was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and
sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so
firm and penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared
being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person.

The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently
mingled with interest. â€œMonsieur,â€ said Morrel, whose uneasiness was
increased by this examination, â€œyou wish to speak to me?â€

â€œYes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?â€

â€œThe house of Thomson & French; at least, so my cashier tells me.â€

â€œHe has told you rightly. The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or
400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict
punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and
charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
otherwise.â€

Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was
covered with perspiration.

â€œSo then, sir,â€ said Morrel, â€œyou hold bills of mine?â€

â€œYes, and for a considerable sum.â€

â€œWhat is the amount?â€ asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render
firm.

20035m



â€œHere is,â€ said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his
pocket, â€œan assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville,
the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You acknowledge, of
course, that you owe this sum to him?â€

â€œYes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent
nearly five years ago.â€

â€œWhen are you to pay?â€

â€œHalf the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.â€

â€œJust so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all
signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.â€

â€œI recognize them,â€ said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought
that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his
own signature. â€œIs this all?â€

â€œNo, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been
assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner
of Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500
francs.â€

It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this
enumeration. â€œTwo hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred
francs,â€ repeated he.

â€œYes, sir,â€ replied the Englishman. â€œI will not,â€ continued he, after a
momentâ€™s silence, â€œconceal from you, that while your probity and
exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the
report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your
liabilities.â€

At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale.

â€œSir,â€ said he, â€œup to this timeâ€”and it is now more than
four-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from
my father, who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty yearsâ€”never
has anything bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored.â€

â€œI know that,â€ replied the Englishman. â€œBut as a man of honor should
answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same
punctuality?â€

Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance
than he had hitherto shown.

â€œTo questions frankly put,â€ said he, â€œa straightforward answer should
be given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely;
for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous
accidents, of which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if
the _Pharaon_ should be lost, and this last resource be goneâ€”â€”â€

The poor manâ€™s eyes filled with tears.

â€œWell,â€ said the other, â€œif this last resource fail you?â€

â€œWell,â€ returned Morrel, â€œit is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but,
already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame. I fear I
shall be forced to suspend payment.â€

â€œHave you no friends who could assist you?â€

Morrel smiled mournfully.

â€œIn business, sir,â€ said he, â€œone has no friends, only correspondents.â€

â€œIt is true,â€ murmured the Englishman; â€œthen you have but one hope.â€

â€œBut one.â€

â€œThe last?â€

â€œThe last.â€

â€œSo that if this failâ€”â€”â€

â€œI am ruined,â€”completely ruined!â€

â€œAs I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.â€

â€œI know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes,
passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house, in
hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed
me of the arrival of this ship.â€

â€œAnd it is not yours?â€

â€œNo, she is a Bordeaux vessel, _La Gironde_; she comes from India also;
but she is not mine.â€

â€œPerhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_, and brings you some tidings
of her?â€

â€œShall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to
receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty is
still hope.â€ Then in a low voice Morrel added,â€”â€œThis delay is not
natural. The _Pharaon_ left Calcutta the 5th of February; she ought to
have been here a month ago.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€ said the Englishman. â€œWhat is the meaning of that
noise?â€

â€œOh, my God!â€ cried Morrel, turning pale, â€œwhat is it?â€

A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and
half-stifled sobs. Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his
strength failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained
opposite one another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger
gazing at him with an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but
it seemed that Morrel expected somethingâ€”something had occasioned the
noise, and something must follow. The stranger fancied he heard
footsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps, which were those of
several persons, stopped at the door. A key was inserted in the lock of
the first door, and the creaking of hinges was audible.

â€œThere are only two persons who have the key to that door,â€ murmured
Morrel, â€œCocles and Julie.â€

At this instant the second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes
bathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting
himself by the arm of the chair. He would have spoken, but his voice
failed him.

â€œOh, father!â€ said she, clasping her hands, â€œforgive your child for
being the bearer of evil tidings.â€

Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.

â€œOh, father, father!â€ murmured she, â€œcourage!â€

â€œThe _Pharaon_ has gone down, then?â€ said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The
young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her
head as she lay on her fatherâ€™s breast.

â€œAnd the crew?â€ asked Morrel.

â€œSaved,â€ said the girl; â€œsaved by the crew of the vessel that has just
entered the harbor.â€

Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation
and sublime gratitude.

â€œThanks, my God,â€ said he, â€œat least thou strikest but me alone.â€

A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman.

â€œCome in, come in,â€ said Morrel, â€œfor I presume you are all at the
door.â€

Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping
bitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible
the rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of
these men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained
himself, and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the
apartment. Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his
hands in hers, Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel
stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between
Morrelâ€™s family and the sailors at the door.

â€œHow did this happen?â€ said Morrel.

â€œDraw nearer, Penelon,â€ said the young man, â€œand tell us all about it.â€

An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the
remains of a hat between his hands.

â€œGood-day, M. Morrel,â€ said he, as if he had just quitted Marseilles
the previous evening, and had just returned from Aix or Toulon.

â€œGood-day, Penelon,â€ returned Morrel, who could not refrain from
smiling through his tears, â€œwhere is the captain?â€

â€œThe captain, M. Morrel,â€”he has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please
God, it wonâ€™t be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and
hearty.â€

â€œWell, now tell your story, Penelon.â€

20039m



Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth,
turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the
antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.

â€œYou see, M. Morrel,â€ said he, â€œwe were somewhere between Cape Blanc
and Cape Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a
weekâ€™s calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to meâ€”I was at the helm I
should tell youâ€”and says, â€˜Penelon, what do you think of those clouds
coming up over there?â€™ I was just then looking at them myself. â€˜What do
I think, captain? Why I think that they are rising faster than they
have any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they
didnâ€™t mean mischief.â€™â€”â€˜Thatâ€™s my opinion too,â€™ said the captain, â€˜and
Iâ€™ll take precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas.
Avast, there, all hands! Take in the studding-sails and stow the flying
jib.â€™ It was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel.
â€˜Ah,â€™ said the captain, â€˜we have still too much canvas set; all hands
lower the mainsail!â€™ Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed
under mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails. â€˜Well, Penelon,â€™ said the
captain, â€˜what makes you shake your head?â€™ â€˜Why,â€™ I says, â€˜I still
think youâ€™ve got too much on.â€™ â€˜I think youâ€™re right,â€™ answered he, â€˜we
shall have a gale.â€™ â€˜A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest,
or I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s what.â€™ You could see the wind coming like the
dust at Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business. â€˜Take
in two reefs in the top-sails,â€™ cried the captain; â€˜let go the
bowlinâ€™s, haul the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the
reef-tackles on the yards.â€™â€

20041m



â€œThat was not enough for those latitudes,â€ said the Englishman; â€œI
should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.â€

His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start. Penelon
put his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus
criticized the manÅ“uvres of his captain.

â€œWe did better than that, sir,â€ said the old sailor respectfully; â€œwe
put the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck
our top-sails and scudded under bare poles.â€

â€œThe vessel was very old to risk that,â€ said the Englishman.

â€œEh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for
twelve hours we sprung a leak. â€˜Penelon,â€™ said the captain, â€˜I think we
are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.â€™ I gave him
the helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water. â€˜All
hands to the pumps!â€™ I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the
more we pumped the more came in. â€˜Ah,â€™ said I, after four hoursâ€™ work,
â€˜since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.â€™ â€˜Is that the
example you set, Penelon?â€™ cries the captain; â€˜very well, wait a
minute.â€™ He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.
â€˜I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,â€™ said
he.â€

â€œWell done!â€ said the Englishman.

20043m



â€œThereâ€™s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,â€ continued
the sailor; â€œand during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone
down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour, but
still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in twelve
hours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes five.
â€˜Come,â€™ said the captain, â€˜we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel
will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship,
let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.â€™
Now,â€ continued Penelon, â€œyou see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to
his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told
twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to
say, â€˜Get alongâ€”save yourselves.â€™ We soon launched the boat, and all
eight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he did
not descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the
waist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It was
time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the
broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then
the other way, spun round and round, and then good-bye to the
_Pharaon_. As for us, we were three days without anything to eat or
drink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the
rest, when we saw _La Gironde_; we made signals of distress, she
perceived us, made for us, and took us all on board. There now, M.
Morrel, thatâ€™s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is not it
true, you fellows there?â€ A general murmur of approbation showed that
the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings.

â€œWell, well,â€ said M. Morrel, â€œI know there was no one in fault but
destiny. It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his
name. What wages are due to you?â€

â€œOh, donâ€™t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.â€

â€œYes, but we will talk of it.â€

â€œWell, then, three months,â€ said Penelon.

â€œCocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,â€ said
Morrel. â€œAt another time,â€ added he, â€œI should have said, Give them,
besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed,
and the little money that remains to me is not my own, so do not think
me mean on this account.â€

Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.

â€œAs for that, M. Morrel,â€ said he, again turning his quid, â€œas for
thatâ€”â€”â€

â€œAs for what?â€

â€œThe money.â€

â€œWellâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present,
and that we will wait for the rest.â€

â€œThanks, my friends, thanks!â€ cried Morrel gratefully; â€œtake itâ€”take
it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are
free to do so.â€

These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman. Penelon
nearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.

â€œWhat, M. Morrel!â€ said he in a low voice, â€œyou send us away; you are
then angry with us!â€

â€œNo, no,â€ said M. Morrel, â€œI am not angry, quite the contrary, and I do
not send you away; but I have no more ships, and therefore I do not
want any sailors.â€

â€œNo more ships!â€ returned Penelon; â€œwell, then, youâ€™ll build some;
weâ€™ll wait for you.â€

â€œI have no money to build ships with, Penelon,â€ said the poor owner
mournfully, â€œso I cannot accept your kind offer.â€

â€œNo more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the
_Pharaon_, under bare poles.â€

â€œEnough, enough!â€ cried Morrel, almost overpowered; â€œleave me, I pray
you; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with them, and
see that my orders are executed.â€

â€œAt least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?â€ asked Penelon.

â€œYes; I hope so, at least. Now go.â€ He made a sign to Cocles, who went
first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. â€œNow,â€
said the owner to his wife and daughter, â€œleave me; I wish to speak
with this gentleman.â€

20045m



And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson & French, who had remained
motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he had taken no
part, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women looked at
this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and retired;
but, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a supplicating
glance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator
would have been surprised to see on his stern features. The two men
were left alone. â€œWell, sir,â€ said Morrel, sinking into a chair, â€œyou
have heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.â€

â€œI see,â€ returned the Englishman, â€œthat a fresh and unmerited
misfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to
serve you.â€

â€œOh, sir!â€ cried Morrel.

â€œLet me see,â€ continued the stranger, â€œI am one of your largest
creditors.â€

â€œYour bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.â€

â€œDo you wish for time to pay?â€

â€œA delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.â€

â€œHow long a delay do you wish for?â€

Morrel reflected. â€œTwo months,â€ said he.

â€œI will give you three,â€ replied the stranger.

â€œBut,â€ asked Morrel, â€œwill the house of Thomson & French consent?â€

â€œOh, I take everything on myself. Today is the 5th of June.â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of
September at eleven oâ€™clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven),
I shall come to receive the money.â€

â€œI shall expect you,â€ returned Morrel; â€œand I will pay youâ€”or I shall
be dead.â€ These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the
stranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed, the old ones
destroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months
before him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his thanks
with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him
with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger
met Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality
she was waiting for him. â€œOh, sirâ€â€”said she, clasping her hands.

â€œMademoiselle,â€ said the stranger, â€œone day you will receive a letter
signed â€˜Sinbad the Sailor.â€™ Do exactly what the letter bids you,
however strange it may appear.â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ returned Julie.

â€œDo you promise?â€

â€œI swear to you I will.â€

â€œIt is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl
you are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you
by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.â€

Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the
baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the
court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in
either hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. â€œCome
with me, my friend,â€ said the Englishman; â€œI wish to speak to you.â€



 Chapter 30. The Fifth of September

The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the
moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so
decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that
fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same
day he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred;
and a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.
Unfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house
of Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards
him; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not
friends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account
for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him;
and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: â€œWe
had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those
300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get
only six or eight per cent of our money back again.â€

Unfortunately, whether through envy or stupidity, all Morrelâ€™s
correspondents did not take this view; and some even came to a contrary
decision. The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with
scrupulous exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the
Englishman, were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality. Cocles thus
remained in his accustomed tranquillity. It was Morrel alone who
remembered with alarm, that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000
francs of M. de Boville, and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills,
for which, as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons, he had
time granted, he must be a ruined man.

The opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses
which had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him
to remain solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the
end of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual
punctuality. Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the
general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner
had been postponed only until the end of the month.

The month passed, and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all
his resources. Formerly his paper, at any date, was taken with
confidence, and was even in request. Morrel now tried to negotiate
bills at ninety days only, and none of the banks would give him credit.
Fortunately, Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely;
and, as they reached him, he found himself in a condition to meet his
engagements when the end of July came.

The agent of Thomson & French had not been again seen at Marseilles;
the day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had
disappeared; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the
mayor, the inspector of prisons, and M. Morrel, his departure left no
trace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors
of the _Pharaon_, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they
also had disappeared.

Captain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.
He delayed presenting himself at Morrelâ€™s, but the owner, hearing of
his arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelonâ€™s
recital, of the captainâ€™s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to
console him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain
Gaumard had not dared to apply for.

As he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.
Penelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was
newly clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much
embarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place,
passed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his
great eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel
as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return. Morrel attributed
Penelonâ€™s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident
the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he
was, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his
bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express
ourselves, worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer. Perhaps he had come
to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment
from his new master.

â€œWorthy fellows!â€ said Morrel,  as he went away, â€œmay your new master
love you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!â€

20049m



August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew
his credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at
Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said
that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that
Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier
Cocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when
the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared
behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with
the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual
precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had
fully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills
which the shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and
then, with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure
was put off until the end of September.

On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme
anxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel
had thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under
great obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing
that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he
had laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment
that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had
unlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his
pocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and
Morrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept
away from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible
availing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he
returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.

Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh
word. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuelâ€™s
hand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the
second floor had sent for Cocles.

â€œThen,â€ said the two women to Emmanuel, â€œwe are indeed ruined.â€

It was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should
write to her brother, who was in garrison at NÃ®mes, to come to them as
speedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they
required all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,
Maximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence
over his father.

He was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided
on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had
consulted young Maximilianâ€™s taste. He had at once declared for a
military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly
through the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the
53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected
promotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was
noted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on
a soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name
of â€œthe stoic.â€ We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this
epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know
what it meant.

This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid
to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon
have to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for
the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles,
Julie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features
betraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he
passed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with
unusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and
exclaimed:

â€œOh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could
ever have believed it!â€

A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three
heavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.

Morrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the
money. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills
receivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of
everything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500
francs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on
account.

However, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest
dejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and
used to take his coffee at the club of the PhocÃ©ens, and read the
_Semaphore_; this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his
office.

As to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he
went into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare
and exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women,
but his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with
the business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung
over the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping
that when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard
him pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his
footsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened
the door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an
hour after Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went
stealthily along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her
husband was doing.

In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy
herself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards Madame
Morrel.

â€œHe is writing,â€ she said.

They had understood each other without speaking. Madame Morrel looked
again through the keyhole, Morrel was writing; but Madame Morrel
remarked, what her daughter had not observed, that her husband was
writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he was writing his
will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to
utter a word.

Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as
usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he
placed his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her
for a long time against his bosom. In the evening, Julie told her
mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that
her fatherâ€™s heart beat violently.

The next two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the
4th of September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his
study. Julie trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen.
Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept, and which
was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl
looked at Morrel.

â€œWhat have I done wrong, father,â€ she said, â€œthat you should take this
key from me?â€

â€œNothing, my dear,â€ replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his
eyes at this simple question,â€”â€œnothing, only I want it.â€

Julie made a pretence to feel for the key. â€œI must have left it in my
room,â€ she said.

And she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to
consult Emmanuel.

â€œDo not give this key to your father,â€ said he, â€œand tomorrow morning,
if possible, do not quit him for a moment.â€

She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he
knew.

During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel
remained listening for every sound, and, until three oâ€™clock in the
morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It
was three oâ€™clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and
daughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since
the previous evening. At eight oâ€™clock in the morning Morrel entered
their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible
in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he
had slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his
daughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and
kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuelâ€™s request, was
following her father when he quitted the room, but he said to her
quickly:

â€œRemain with your mother, dearest.â€ Julie wished to accompany him. â€œI
wish you to do so,â€ said he.

This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a
tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She
remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant
afterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth
pressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.

20053m



â€œMaximilian, my dearest brother!â€ she cried.

At these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her sonâ€™s
arms.

â€œMother,â€ said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and
her daughter, â€œwhat has occurredâ€”what has happened? Your letter has
frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.â€

â€œJulie,â€ said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, â€œgo and
tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.â€

The young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of
the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand.

â€œAre you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?â€ inquired the man, with a
strong Italian accent.

â€œYes, sir,â€ replied Julie with hesitation; â€œwhat is your pleasure? I do
not know you.â€

â€œRead this letter,â€ he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. â€œIt
concerns the best interests of your father,â€ said the messenger.

The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly
and read:

â€œGo this moment to the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, enter the house No. 15, ask
the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the
apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in
red silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should
receive it before eleven oâ€™clock. You promised to obey me implicitly.
Remember your oath.

â€œSinbad the Sailor.â€

The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to
question the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes again
over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a
postscript. She read:

â€œIt is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and
alone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else
go in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything
about it.â€

This postscript decreased greatly the young girlâ€™s happiness. Was there
nothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her innocence
had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl
of her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it;
indeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that
inspire the greatest terror.

Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular
impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,
but to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on
the day when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her fatherâ€™s,
related the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made,
and showed him the letter.

â€œYou must go, then, mademoiselle,â€ said Emmanuel.

â€œGo there?â€ murmured Julie.

â€œYes; I will accompany you.â€

â€œBut did you not read that I must be alone?â€ said Julie.

â€œAnd you shall be alone,â€ replied the young man. â€œI will await you at
the corner of the Rue du MusÃ©e, and if you are so long absent as to
make me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you
shall have cause to complain to me!â€

â€œThen, Emmanuel?â€ said the young girl with hesitation, â€œit is your
opinion that I should obey this invitation?â€

â€œYes. Did not the messenger say your fatherâ€™s safety depended upon it?â€

â€œBut what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?â€ she asked.

Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide
immediately made him reply.

â€œListen,â€ he said; â€œtoday is the 5th of September, is it not?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œToday, then, at eleven oâ€™clock, your father has nearly three hundred
thousand francs to pay?â€

â€œYes, we know that.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ continued Emmanuel, â€œwe have not fifteen thousand francs
in the house.â€

â€œWhat will happen then?â€

â€œWhy, if today before eleven oâ€™clock your father has not found someone
who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve oâ€™clock to
declare himself a bankrupt.â€

â€œOh, come, then, come!â€ cried she, hastening away with the young man.

During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young
man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which had
befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of
living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached
such a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the
apartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study,
but he rapped there in vain.

While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door
open, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study,
M. Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment
quitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of
whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,
pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.
Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his
fatherâ€™s neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on
Morrelâ€™s breast.

â€œFather,â€ he exclaimed, turning pale as death, â€œwhat are you going to
do with that brace of pistols under your coat?â€

â€œOh, this is what I feared!â€ said Morrel.

â€œFather, father, in Heavenâ€™s name,â€ exclaimed the young man, â€œwhat are
these weapons for?â€

â€œMaximilian,â€ replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, â€œyou are a
man, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.â€

And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian
followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed
it behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on
which he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open
ledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his
affairs. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he
possessed was 15,257 francs.

â€œRead!â€ said Morrel.

The young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What
could he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?

â€œAnd have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this
disastrous result?â€ asked the young man, after a momentâ€™s pause.

â€œI have,â€ replied Morrel.

â€œYou have no money coming in on which you can rely?â€

â€œNone.â€

â€œYou have exhausted every resource?â€

â€œAll.â€

â€œAnd in half an hour,â€ said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, â€œour name is
dishonored!â€

â€œBlood washes out dishonor,â€ said Morrel.

â€œYou are right, father; I understand you.â€ Then extending his hand
towards one of the pistols, he said, â€œThere is one for you and one for
meâ€”thanks!â€

Morrel caught his hand. â€œYour motherâ€”your sister! Who will support
them?â€

A shudder ran through the young manâ€™s frame. â€œFather,â€ he said, â€œdo you
reflect that you are bidding me to live?â€

â€œYes, I do so bid you,â€ answered Morrel, â€œit is your duty. You have a
calm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I
make no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as
if it were your own, and then judge for yourself.â€

The young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime
resignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he
took off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank.

â€œBe it so, then, my father,â€ he said, extending his hand to Morrel,
â€œdie in peace, my father; I will live.â€

Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son, but
Maximilian caught him in his arms, and those two noble hearts were
pressed against each other for a moment.

â€œYou know it is not my fault,â€ said Morrel.

20057m



Maximilian smiled. â€œI know, father, you are the most honorable man I
have ever known.â€

â€œGood, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your
mother and sister.â€

â€œMy father,â€ said the young man, bending his knee, â€œbless me!â€ Morrel
took the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and
kissing his forehead several times said:

â€œOh, yes, yes, I bless you in my own name, and in the name of three
generations of irreproachable men, who say through me, â€˜The edifice
which misfortune has destroyed, Providence may build up again.â€™ On
seeing me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you.
To you, perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me.
Then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor. Go to work,
labor, young man, struggle ardently and courageously; live, yourself,
your mother and sister, with the most rigid economy, so that from day
to day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and
fructify. Reflect how glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn,
that day of complete restoration, on which you will say in this very
office, â€˜My father died because he could not do what I have this day
done; but he died calmly and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I
should do.â€™â€

â€œMy father, my father!â€ cried the young man, â€œwhy should you not live?â€

â€œIf I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be
converted into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man
who has broken his word, failed in his engagementsâ€”in fact, only a
bankrupt. If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse
is that of an honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would
avoid my house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last
home. Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your
head and say, â€˜I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first
time, he has been compelled to break his word.â€™â€

The young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.

â€œAnd now,â€ said Morrel, â€œleave me alone, and endeavor to keep your
mother and sister away.â€

â€œWill you not see my sister once more?â€ asked Maximilian. A last but
final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this
interview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. â€œI
saw her this morning, and bade her adieu.â€

â€œHave you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?â€ inquired
Maximilian in a faltering voice.

â€œYes; my son, and a sacred command.â€

â€œSay it, my father.â€

â€œThe house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or,
it may be, selfishnessâ€”it is not for me to read menâ€™s heartsâ€”has had
any pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to
receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,
but offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my
son, and respect this man.â€

â€œFather, I will,â€ said Maximilian.

â€œAnd now, once more, adieu,â€ said Morrel. â€œGo, leave me; I would be
alone. You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom.â€

The young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of
will and not the power of execution.

â€œHear me, Maximilian,â€ said his father. â€œSuppose I were a soldier like
you, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I must be
killed in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just now,
â€˜Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is preferable
to shame!â€™â€

â€œYes, yes,â€ said the young man, â€œyes;â€ and once again embracing his
father with convulsive pressure, he said, â€œBe it so, my father.â€

And he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel
remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then
putting forth his arm, he pulled the bell. After a momentâ€™s interval,
Cocles appeared.

It was no longer the same manâ€”the fearful revelations of the three last
days had crushed him. This thoughtâ€”the house of Morrel is about to stop
paymentâ€”bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise
have done.

â€œMy worthy Cocles,â€ said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, â€œdo
you remain in the antechamber. When the gentleman who came three months
agoâ€”the agent of Thomson & Frenchâ€”arrives, announce his arrival to me.â€

Cocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the
anteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell back in his chair, his eyes
fixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left, that was all. The
hand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.

What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony
cannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was
surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced
himself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly
plausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the
world, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings,
one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation
and its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on.
The pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and
murmured his daughterâ€™s name. Then he laid it down, seized his pen, and
wrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient
farewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the clock,
counting time now not by minutes, but by seconds.

He took up the deadly weapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed
on the clock, and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he
cocked the pistol. At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came
forth upon his brow, a pang stronger than death clutched at his
heart-strings. He heard the door of the staircase creak on its
hingesâ€”the clock gave its warning to strike elevenâ€”the door of his
study opened. Morrel did not turn roundâ€”he expected these words of
Cocles, â€œThe agent of Thomson & French.â€

He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard
a cryâ€”it was his daughterâ€™s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol
fell from his hands.

â€œMy father!â€ cried the young girl, out of breath, and half dead with
joyâ€”â€œsaved, you are saved!â€ And she threw herself into his arms,
holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.

20061m



â€œSaved, my child!â€ said Morrel; â€œwhat do you mean?â€

â€œYes, savedâ€”saved! See, see!â€ said the young girl.

Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague
remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end
was the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a
diamond as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of
parchment: _Julieâ€™s Dowry_.

Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this
moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer
fell upon his heart.

â€œExplain, my child,â€ he said, â€œExplain, my child,â€ he said,
â€œexplainâ€”where did you find this purse?â€

â€œIn a house in the AllÃ©es de Meilhan, No. 15, on the corner of a
mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.â€

â€œBut,â€ cried Morrel, â€œthis purse is not yours!â€ Julie handed to her
father the letter she had received in the morning.

â€œAnd did you go alone?â€ asked Morrel, after he had read it.

â€œEmmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the
corner of the Rue du MusÃ©e, but, strange to say, he was not there when
I returned.â€

â€œMonsieur Morrel!â€ exclaimed a voice on the stairs; â€œMonsieur Morrel!â€

â€œIt is his voice!â€ said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel entered, his
countenance full of animation and joy.

â€œThe _Pharaon_!â€ he cried; â€œthe _Pharaon_!â€

â€œWhat!â€”what!â€”the _Pharaon_! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know the vessel
is lost.â€

â€œThe _Pharaon_, sirâ€”they signal the _Pharaon_! The _Pharaon_ is
entering the harbor!â€

Morrel fell back in his chair, his strength was failing him; his
understanding weakened by such events, refused to comprehend such
incredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts. But his son came in.

â€œFather,â€ cried Maximilian, â€œhow could you say the _Pharaon_ was lost?
The lookout has signalled her, and they say she is now coming into
port.â€

20063m



â€œMy dear friends,â€ said Morrel, â€œif this be so, it must be a miracle of
heaven! Impossible, impossible!â€

But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his
hand, the acceptance receiptedâ€”the splendid diamond.

â€œAh, sir,â€ exclaimed Cocles, â€œwhat can it mean?â€”the _Pharaon_?â€

â€œCome, dear ones,â€ said Morrel, rising from his seat, â€œlet us go and
see, and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!â€

They all went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been
afraid to go up into the study. In a moment they were at the CanebiÃ¨re.
There was a crowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel.
â€œThe _Pharaon_! the _Pharaon_!â€ said every voice.

And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship
bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, â€œThe
_Pharaon_, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.â€ She was the exact duplicate of
the other _Pharaon_, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and
indigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain
Gaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M.
Morrel. To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of
the senses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the
testimony.

As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and
amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with
his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the
sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a
low tone:

â€œBe happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and
wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your
good deeds.â€

20064m



And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his
hiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights
of steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted
â€œJacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!â€

Then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a
yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity
of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping
with joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around
him, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to
be seeking in the skies.

â€œAnd now,â€ said the unknown, â€œfarewell kindness, humanity, and
gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have
been Heavenâ€™s substitute to recompense the goodâ€”now the god of
vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!â€

At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,
the yacht instantly put out to sea.



 Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor

Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the
first society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron
Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival
at Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years
had inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert.

As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome,
especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del
Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the
proprietor of the HÃ´tel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve
comfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had
only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the
low charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to
make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.
As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few
days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or
three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a
fancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of
Bonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.

One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring
that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and
lay down, and said to the crew,â€”â€œTo the Island of Elba!â€

The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz
disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having
followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and
re-embarked for Marciana.

Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that
red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in
killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he
returned to the boat very much out of temper.

â€œAh, if your excellency chose,â€ said the captain, â€œyou might have
capital sport.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œDo you see that island?â€ continued the captain, pointing to a conical
pile rising from the indigo sea.

â€œWell, what is this island?â€

â€œThe Island of Monte Cristo.â€

â€œBut I have no permission to shoot over this island.â€

â€œYour excellency does not require a permit, for the island is
uninhabited.â€

â€œAh, indeed!â€ said the young man. â€œA desert island in the midst of the
Mediterranean must be a curiosity.â€

â€œIt is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not
contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.â€

â€œTo whom does this island belong?â€

â€œTo Tuscany.â€

â€œWhat game shall I find there!â€

â€œThousands of wild goats.â€

â€œWho live upon the stones, I suppose,â€ said Franz with an incredulous
smile.

â€œNo, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices
of the rocks.â€

â€œWhere can I sleep?â€

â€œOn shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your
excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you likeâ€”we can sail as
well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.â€

As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet
available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the
affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
â€œWell,â€ asked he, â€œwhat now? Is there any difficulty in the way?â€

â€œNo.â€ replied the captain, â€œbut we must warn your excellency that the
island is an infected port.â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

â€œMonte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge
for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and
Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have
to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.â€

â€œThe deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,
thatâ€™s as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a
waitâ€”too long.â€

â€œBut who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?â€

â€œOh, I shall not,â€ cried Franz.

â€œNor I, nor I,â€ chorused the sailors.

â€œThen steer for Monte Cristo.â€

The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon
sailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in
order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken
their placesâ€”three forward, and one at the helmâ€”he resumed the
conversation. â€œGaetano,â€ said he to the captain, â€œyou tell me Monte
Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very
different kind of game from the goats.â€

â€œYes, your excellency, and it is true.â€

â€œI knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of
Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in
the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.â€

â€œYour excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who
were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,
every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency
heard that the French _chargÃ© dâ€™affaires_ was robbed six months ago
within five hundred paces of Velletri?â€

â€œOh, yes, I heard that.â€

â€œWell, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would
hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English
yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita
Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,
doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has
met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who
have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some
desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses
of a forest.â€

â€œBut,â€ asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the
boat, â€œwhy do not those who have been plundered complain to the French,
Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?â€

â€œWhy?â€ said Gaetano with a smile.

â€œYes, why?â€

â€œBecause, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their
own boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand
and foot, they attach to everyoneâ€™s neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball,
a large hole is chopped in the vesselâ€™s bottom, and then they leave
her. At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and
settle down. First one gunâ€™l goes under, then the other. Then they lift
and sink again, and both go under at once. All at once thereâ€™s a noise
like a cannonâ€”thatâ€™s the air blowing up the deck. Soon the water rushes
out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last
groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool
in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but
the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the
sea. Do you understand now,â€ said the captain, â€œwhy no complaints are
made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?â€

It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing
the expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had
started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of
those men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents
itself, combat it with the most unalterable coolness. Calm and
resolute, he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a
duel,â€”calculated its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all,
as a point of strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an
opening for attack, and won victory at a single thrust.

â€œBah!â€ said he, â€œI have travelled through Sicily and Calabriaâ€”I have
sailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the
shadow of a bandit or a pirate.â€

â€œI did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,â€
replied Gaetano, â€œbut you questioned me, and I have answered; thatâ€™s
all.â€

â€œYes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy
it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.â€

The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and
they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near
the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that
they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like
cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the
crevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil
yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully
watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a
few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.

They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to
set behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing
their rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant
Adamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the
light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in
shadow. Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive
before it the last rays of the expiring day; at last the reflection
rested on the summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like
the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit
as it had covered the base, and the island now only appeared to be a
gray mountain that grew continually darker; half an hour after, the
night was quite dark.

Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every
rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity
Franz was not without uneasinessâ€”Corsica had long since disappeared,
and Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the
lynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the
slightest hesitation.

An hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied he saw, at
a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not
precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the
sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent;
suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a
cloud, but the fire was not a meteor.

â€œWhat is this light?â€ asked he.

â€œHush!â€ said the captain; â€œit is a fire.â€

â€œBut you told me the island was uninhabited?â€

â€œI said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it
served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.â€

â€œAnd for pirates?â€

â€œAnd for pirates,â€ returned Gaetano, repeating Franzâ€™s words. â€œIt is
for that reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you
see, the fire is behind us.â€

â€œBut this fire?â€ continued Franz. â€œIt seems to me rather reassuring
than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a
fire.â€

â€œOh, that goes for nothing,â€ said Gaetano. â€œIf you can guess the
position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire
cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.â€

â€œYou think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant
neighbors?â€

â€œThat is what we must find out,â€ returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on
this terrestrial star.

â€œHow can you find out?â€

â€œYou shall see.â€

Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutesâ€™
discussion a manÅ“uvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack
about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the
fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The pilot again
changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the island,
and was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail, and
the boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the
moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.

Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the
responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him,
while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row
away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult. As for
Franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two
double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the
priming, and waited quietly.

During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and
secured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no
shoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his
finger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam
towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear
the slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line
in his wake. This track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had
touched the shore.

Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same
luminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.

â€œWell?â€ exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.

â€œThey are Spanish smugglers,â€ said he; â€œthey have with them two
Corsican bandits.â€

â€œAnd what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish
smugglers?â€

â€œAlas,â€ returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,
â€œwe ought always to help one another. Very often the bandits are hard
pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good
fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you
canâ€™t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for
greater security we stand out to sea. This costs us nothing, and saves
the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the
first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where
we can land our goods without interruption.â€

â€œAh!â€ said Franz, â€œthen you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?â€

â€œYour excellency, we must live somehow,â€ returned the other, smiling
impenetrably.

â€œThen you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?â€

â€œOh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by
signs.â€

â€œAnd do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?â€

â€œNothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.â€

â€œBut these two Corsican bandits?â€ said Franz, calculating the chances
of peril.

â€œIt is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the
authorities.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œBecause they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in
a Corsicanâ€™s nature to revenge himself.â€

â€œWhat do you mean by having made a stiff?â€”having assassinated a man?â€
said Franz, continuing his investigation.

â€œI mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
thing,â€ returned the captain.

â€œWell,â€ said the young man, â€œlet us demand hospitality of these
smugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?â€

â€œWithout doubt.â€

â€œHow many are they?â€

â€œFour, and the two bandits make six.â€

â€œJust our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able
to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.â€

â€œYes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.â€

â€œBy all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do
more than permit, I exhort you.â€

â€œSilence, then!â€ said Gaetano.

Everyone obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its
true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with
sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to
him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who
had often examined his weapons,â€”which were very beautiful,â€”if not with
envy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,
without any other escort than these men, on an island which had,
indeed, a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely
to afford him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits.
The history of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable
during the day, seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between
two possible sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his
gun in his hand.

The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more
cleaving the waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now
more accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat
was sailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire
more brilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated. The
blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the
light, carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were
opposite the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a
fishing song, of which his companions sung the chorus.

At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and
approached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently
seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions.
They soon appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one,
who remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a
goat was roasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore,
the man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the
manner of a sentinel, and cried, â€œWho comes there?â€ in Sardinian.

Franz coolly cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words
with this man which the traveller did not understand, but which
evidently concerned him.

â€œWill your excellency give your name, or remain _incognito_?â€ asked the
captain.

â€œMy name must rest unknown,â€ replied Franz; â€œmerely say I am a
Frenchman travelling for pleasure.â€

As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an
order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared
among the rocks. Not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz
with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers
with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was
evident that they mutually observed each other.

The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to
that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the
sentinel, who, turning to the boat, said, â€œ_Sâ€™accommodi_.â€ The Italian
_sâ€™accommodi_ is untranslatable; it means at once, â€œCome, enter, you
are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the master.â€ It is like
that Turkish phrase of MoliÃ¨reâ€™s that so astonished the bourgeois
gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance.

The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the
oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few
words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came
Franz. One of his guns was swung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the
other, and a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy,
did not excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude. The
boat was moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a
comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit
the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out:

â€œNot that way, if you please.â€

Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while
two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.

They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade
surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike
sentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks
and thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass
of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover
this retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the
wandering visitors of Monte Cristo.

As for his suspicions, once on _terra firma_, once that he had seen the
indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had
quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to
appetite. He mentioned this to Gaetano, who replied that nothing could
be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat,
bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them by.

â€œBesides,â€ added he, â€œif the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I
will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.â€

â€œYou are a born diplomat,â€ returned Franz; â€œgo and try.â€

Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with
which they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of
the roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.

â€œWell,â€ said Franz, â€œanything new?â€”do they refuse?â€

â€œOn the contrary,â€ returned Gaetano, â€œthe chief, who was told you were
a young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.â€

â€œWell,â€ observed Franz, â€œthis chief is very polite, and I see no
objectionâ€”the more so as I bring my share of the supper.â€

â€œOh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive
you at his house.â€

â€œHis house? Has he built one here, then?â€

â€œNo, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.â€

â€œYou know this chief, then?â€

â€œI have heard talk of him.â€

â€œFavorably or otherwise?â€

â€œBoth.â€

â€œThe deuce!â€”and what is this condition?â€

â€œThat you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he
himself bids you.â€

Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this
proposal. â€œAh,â€ replied he, guessing Franzâ€™s thought, â€œI know this is a
serious matter.â€

â€œWhat should you do in my place?â€

â€œI, who have nothing to lose,â€”I should go.â€

20075m



â€œYou would accept?â€

â€œYes, were it only out of curiosity.â€

â€œThere is something very peculiar about this chief, then?â€

â€œListen,â€ said Gaetano, lowering his voice, â€œI do not know if what they
say is trueâ€â€”he stopped to see if anyone was near.

â€œWhat do they say?â€

â€œThat this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is
nothing.â€

â€œWhat nonsense!â€ said Franz, reseating himself.

â€œIt is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the _Saint
Ferdinand_, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such
treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.â€

â€œDo you know,â€ observed Franz, â€œthat with such stories you make me
think of Ali Babaâ€™s enchanted cavern?â€

â€œI tell you what I have been told.â€

â€œThen you advise me to accept?â€

â€œOh, I donâ€™t say that; your excellency will do as you please; I should
be sorry to advise you in the matter.â€

Franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so
rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he
had, and seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. Gaetano
departed with the reply. Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he
possibly could concerning his host. He turned towards the sailor, who,
during this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the
air of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had
landed, as no vessel of any kind was visible.

â€œNever mind that,â€ returned the sailor, â€œI know their vessel.â€

â€œIs it a very beautiful vessel?â€

â€œI would not wish for a better to sail round the world.â€

â€œOf what burden is she?â€

â€œAbout a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is
what the English call a yacht.â€

â€œWhere was she built?â€

â€œI know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.â€

â€œAnd how did a leader of smugglers,â€ continued Franz, â€œventure to build
a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?â€

â€œI did not say that the owner was a smuggler,â€ replied the sailor.

â€œNo; but Gaetano did, I thought.â€

â€œGaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then
spoken to anyone.â€

â€œAnd if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?â€

â€œA wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.â€

â€œCome,â€ thought Franz, â€œhe is still more mysterious, since the two
accounts do not agree.â€

â€œWhat is his name?â€

â€œIf you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his
real name.â€

â€œSinbad the Sailor?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd where does he reside?â€

â€œOn the sea.â€

â€œWhat country does he come from?â€

â€œI do not know.â€

â€œHave you ever seen him?â€

â€œSometimes.â€

â€œWhat sort of a man is he?â€

â€œYour excellency will judge for yourself.â€

â€œWhere will he receive me?â€

â€œNo doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.â€

â€œHave you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this
island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?â€

â€œOh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto
all over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening;
they say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.â€

â€œDecidedly,â€ muttered Franz, â€œthis is an Arabian Nightsâ€™ adventure.â€

â€œHis excellency waits for you,â€ said a voice, which he recognized as
that of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yachtâ€™s crew.

Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the
man who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his
eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some
indiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make
the least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.

Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and
preceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the
appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was
passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,
evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not
allow Gaetano to goâ€”a refusal he could now comprehend.

Presently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were
entering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a
crackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed,
and became balmy and perfumed. At length his feet touched on a thick
and soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him. There was a
momentâ€™s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with
a foreign accent, said:

â€œWelcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.â€

It may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this
permission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the
presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a
Tunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk
tassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep
red, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold
like the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round
his waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his
girdle.

Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably
handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite
straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek
type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration
by the black moustache that encircled them.

His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had
been long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow
and hue of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made,
and, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet. But what
astonished Franz, who had treated Gaetanoâ€™s description as a fable, was
the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.

The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers
of gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of
Arabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with
gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful
shape and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which
they sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz
had entered, and also in front of another door, leading into a second
apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.

The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover,
returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.

â€œSir,â€ he said, after a pause, â€œa thousand excuses for the precaution
taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the greater portion
of the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of this abode were
discovered, I should doubtless, find on my return my temporary
retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be exceedingly
annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I should not
have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest
of mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you forget this
temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not
expect to find hereâ€”that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty
comfortable beds.â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, my dear sir,â€ replied Franz, â€œmake no apologies. I have
always observed that they bandage peopleâ€™s eyes who penetrate enchanted
palaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the _Huguenots_, and really I
have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of the
wonders of the _Arabian Nights_.â€

20079m



â€œAlas! I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the honor
of your visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my
hermitage, it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to
share, if you will. Ali, is the supper ready?â€

At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony,
and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all
was prepared in the dining-room.

â€œNow,â€ said the unknown to Franz, â€œI do not know if you are of my
opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or
three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to
address one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of
hospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me
one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself,
that I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called
â€˜Sinbad the Sailor.â€™â€

â€œAnd I,â€ replied Franz, â€œwill tell you, as I only require his wonderful
lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at
this moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will keep us from
going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been
conveyed by some good genius.â€

â€œWell, then, Signor Aladdin,â€ replied the singular Amphitryon, â€œyou
heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the
dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?â€

At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.
Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was
splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast
his eyes around him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than
the room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique
bas-reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this
apartment, which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having
baskets in their hands. These baskets contained four pyramids of most
splendid fruit; there were Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from
Malaga, oranges from the Balearic Isles, peaches from France, and dates
from Tunis.

The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican
blackbirds; a boarâ€™s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar
sauce, a glorious turbot, and a gigantic lobster. Between these large
dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties. The dishes were
of silver, and the plates of Japanese china.

Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a
dream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so
admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.

â€œYes,â€ replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease
and graceâ€”â€œyes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does
all he can to prove it. He remembers that I saved his life, and as he
has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for
having kept it on his shoulders.â€

Ali approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.

â€œWould it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,â€ said Franz, â€œto ask you the
particulars of this kindness?â€

20081m



â€œOh, they are simple enough,â€ replied the host. â€œIt seems the fellow
had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than
etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the Bey
to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue
the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I always
had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his
tongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali
a splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of
having. He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the
poor devilâ€™s punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass
with which I had shivered his highnessâ€™s yataghan to pieces, the Bey
yielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that
the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless
clause in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse
of the shores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to
appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.â€

Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to
think of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related
the brief narrative.

â€œAnd like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,â€ he said,
by way of changing the conversation, â€œyou pass your life in
travelling?â€

â€œYes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be
able to accomplish it,â€ said the unknown with a singular smile; â€œand I
made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.â€

Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes
gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.

â€œYou have suffered a great deal, sir?â€ said Franz inquiringly.

Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, â€œWhat makes
you suppose so?â€

â€œEverything,â€ answered Franz,â€”â€œyour voice, your look, your pallid
complexion, and even the life you lead.â€

â€œI?â€”I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha. I am
king of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I
get tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like
one; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself by
delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I
have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or
appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you
had tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never
return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish
there.â€

â€œRevenge, for instance!â€ observed Franz.

The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate
into the depth of the heart and thoughts. â€œAnd why revenge?â€ he asked.

â€œBecause,â€ replied Franz, â€œyou seem to me like a man who, persecuted by
society, has a fearful account to settle with it.â€

â€œAh!â€ responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which
displayed his white and sharp teeth. â€œYou have not guessed rightly.
Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I
shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little
blue cloak.â€

â€œAnd will that be the first time you ever took that journey?â€

â€œYes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you
that it is not my fault I have delayed it so longâ€”it will happen one
day or the other.â€

20083m



â€œAnd do you propose to make this journey very shortly?â€

â€œI do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain
arrangements.â€

â€œI should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor to
repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality
displayed to me at Monte Cristo.â€

â€œI should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,â€ replied the host,
â€œbut, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability,
_incognito_.â€

The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the
unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to
which his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or
rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them
on the table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with
a silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table
roused Franzâ€™s curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of
greenish paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was
perfectly unknown to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the
cup contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting
his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.

â€œYou cannot guess,â€ said he, â€œwhat there is in that small vase, can
you?â€

â€œNo, I really cannot.â€

â€œWell, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia
which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.â€

â€œBut,â€ replied Franz, â€œthis ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through
mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human
name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which,
to tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?â€

â€œAh, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,â€ cried Sinbad;
â€œwe frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without
regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing
it. Are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god? taste
this, and the mines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to you.
Are you a man of imaginationâ€”a poet? taste this, and the boundaries of
possibility disappear; the fields of infinite space open to you, you
advance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of
unfettered reverie. Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the
greatnesses of the earth? taste this, and in an hour you will be a
king, not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe
like France, Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the
universe, king of creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you
will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth. Is it not
tempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is
only to do thus? look!â€

At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance
so lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his
lips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent
backwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite
sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:

â€œWhat, then, is this precious stuff?â€

â€œDid you ever hear,â€ he replied, â€œof the Old Man of the Mountain, who
attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?â€

â€œOf course I have.â€

â€œWell, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the
mountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were
magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens
isolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and
there, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which
transported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,
ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took
for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,
so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave
it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck
down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing
that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life
of delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a
slight foretaste.â€

â€œThen,â€ cried Franz, â€œit is hashish! I know thatâ€”by name at least.â€

â€œThat is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashishâ€”the purest and
most unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,â€”the hashish of Abou-Gor, the
celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a
palace, inscribed with these words, _A grateful world to the dealer in
happiness_.â€

â€œDo you know,â€ said Franz, â€œI have a very great inclination to judge
for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.â€

â€œJudge for yourself, Signor Aladdinâ€”judge, but do not confine yourself
to one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a
fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle
in nature against this divine substance,â€”in nature which is not made
for joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat,
the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme,
then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what
changes occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with
the joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no
longer, but to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane
sphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan
spring for a Lapland winterâ€”to quit paradise for earthâ€”heaven for hell!
Taste the hashish, guest of mineâ€”taste the hashish.â€

Franzâ€™s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous
preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift
it to his mouth.

â€œ_Diable!_â€ he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve. â€œI do
not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the
thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.â€

â€œBecause your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the
substances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea,
porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did
you like them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their
pheasants with assafÅ“tida, and the Chinese eat swallowsâ€™ nests? Eh? no!
Well, it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in
the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which
now appears to you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the
adjoining chamber, which is your apartment, and Ali will bring us
coffee and pipes.â€

They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbadâ€”and whom we
have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some
title by which to distinguish himâ€”gave some orders to the servant,
Franz entered still another apartment.

It was simply yet richly furnished. It was round, and a large divan
completely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered
with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there
were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from
Bengal; panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those
that appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway,
and so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the
other, so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or
reclining on the most luxurious bed.

Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes
and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there
was no need to smoke the same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which
Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.

There was a momentâ€™s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to
thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of
his conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie,
into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems
to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the
smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul. Ali brought in the
coffee.

â€œHow do you take it?â€ inquired the unknown; â€œin the French or Turkish
style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling? As you please;
it is ready in all ways.â€

â€œI will take it in the Turkish style,â€ replied Franz.

â€œAnd you are right,â€ said his host; â€œit shows you have a tendency for
an Oriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men who know
how to live. As for me,â€ he added, with one of those singular smiles
which did not escape the young man, â€œwhen I have completed my affairs
in Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me
again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.â€

20087m



â€œ_Ma foi_,â€ said Franz, â€œit would be the easiest thing in the world;
for I feel eagleâ€™s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those
wings I could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.â€

â€œAh, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your wings,
and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over
you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we
are here to ease your fall.â€

He then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience
and withdrew, but not to any distance.

As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the
bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the
events of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the
first approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be
aware of the coming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy
lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses
seemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it
was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen
before he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all
the blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of
the summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his
sailors,â€”songs so clear and sonorous, that they would have made a
divine harmony had their notes been taken down,â€”he saw the Island of
Monte Cristo, no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the
waves, but as an oasis in the desert; then, as his boat drew nearer,
the songs became louder, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose
to heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or
Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.

At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without
shock, as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued
strains of most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to
descend, several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that
which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from
such perfumes as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the
very senses; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from
Sinbad, his singular host, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed
to fade away and become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows
of the magic lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the
chamber of statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps
which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.

They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy,
with eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair.
They were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated
courtesans. Then among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian
angel in the midst of Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm
shadows, those soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow
before these marble wantons.

Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and
approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in
their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves,
and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which
saints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which
the serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that
held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a
voluptuous kiss.

It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about
him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a
dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips
of stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so
that to Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug,
love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were
pressed to his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like
embraces. The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more
his senses yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle
that taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and
exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the
enchantment of his marvellous dream.



 Chapter 32. The Waking

When Franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He
thought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity
scarcely penetrated. He stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he
rose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of
dry heather, very soft and odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if
the statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at
his waking.

He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and
to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality.
He found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through
a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and water
were shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors
were sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the
boat was at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.

There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his
brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left
against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some
time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the
things of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually
this view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him
of the illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He
recalled his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler
chief, a subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and
a spoonful of hashish.

It seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a
year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the
impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it
taken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid
the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the
shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses. Otherwise,
his head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from
the slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of
lightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the
bright sunshine more vividly than ever.

He went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived
him; and the patron, accosting him, said:

â€œThe Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and
desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his
leave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important
business calls him to Malaga.â€

â€œSo, then, Gaetano,â€ said Franz, â€œthis is, then, all reality; there
exists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right
royally, and has departed while I was asleep?â€

â€œHe exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all
her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all
probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.â€

So saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was
making sail towards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his
telescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.
At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards
the shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he
had been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to
his guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his
handkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud
of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as
it expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.

â€œThere, do you hear?â€ observed Gaetano; â€œhe is bidding you adieu.â€

The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any
idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the
yacht from the shore.

â€œWhat are your excellencyâ€™s orders?â€ inquired Gaetano.

â€œIn the first place, light me a torch.â€

â€œAh, yes, I understand,â€ replied the patron, â€œto find the entrance to
the enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it
would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too
have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has
come over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,â€
he added, â€œand give it to his excellency.â€

Giovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean
grotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had
awaked by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he
carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw
nothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him
attempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave
a foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without
strict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade
of his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not
lean and press in the hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he
lost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless. At
the end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.

When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a
small white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass,
but even then he could not distinguish anything.

Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting
goats, which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and
began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a
duty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of
an hour he had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild
and agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz
could not consider them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more
enthralling, occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he had
really been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One
Nights_, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.

Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,
after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second
visit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the
repast ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the
previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper;
and he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave,
continuing her flight towards Corsica.

â€œWhy,â€ he remarked to Gaetano, â€œyou told me that Signor Sinbad was
going to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of
Porto-Vecchio.â€

â€œDonâ€™t you remember,â€ said the patron, â€œI told you that among the crew
there were two Corsican brigands?â€

â€œTrue; and he is going to land them,â€ added Franz.

â€œPrecisely so,â€ replied Gaetano. â€œAh, he is one who fears neither God
nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his
course to do a poor devil a service.â€

20093m



â€œBut such services as these might involve him with the authorities of
the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,â€ said
Franz.

â€œAnd what cares he for that,â€ replied Gaetano with a laugh, â€œor any
authorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him! Why, in the
first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any
frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on
the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?â€

It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franzâ€™s host, had the
honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along
the whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional
privileges. As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at
Monte Cristo. He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the
grotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being
ready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way. At the
moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it
disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio. With it was effaced the last
trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish,
statues,â€”all became a dream for Franz.

The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the
sun rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo.

When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment
at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his
affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he
should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.

He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane
by the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained
beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastriniâ€™s hotel. But
this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with
people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur
which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great
events in every year,â€”the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the
Feast of St. Peter.

All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy,
between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station
between this world and the nextâ€”a sublime spot, a resting-place full of
poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six
times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.

At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually
increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.
On his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to
hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that
there was no room for him at the HÃ´tel de Londres. Then he sent his
card to Signor Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan
succeeded; and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for
having made his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the
candlestick from the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller
and was about to lead him to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.

The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms
looked on to the streetâ€”a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as
an inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very
rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the
host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller
belonged.

â€œVery good, signor Pastrini,â€ said Franz; â€œbut we must have some supper
instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.â€

â€œAs to supper,â€ replied the landlord, â€œyou shall be served immediately;
but as for the carriageâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat as to the carriage?â€ exclaimed Albert. â€œCome, come, Signor
Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied the host, â€œwe will do all in our power to procure you
oneâ€”this is all I can say.â€

â€œAnd when shall we know?â€ inquired Franz.

â€œTomorrow morning,â€ answered the innkeeper.

â€œOh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, thatâ€™s all, I see plainly
enough. At Drakeâ€™s or Aaronâ€™s one pays twenty-five lire for common
days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast
days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and
thereâ€™s an end of it.â€

â€œI am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a
carriage.â€

â€œThen they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the
journey, but thatâ€™s no matter.â€

â€œThere are no horses.â€

Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not
understand.

â€œDo you understand that, my dear Franzâ€”no horses?â€ he said, â€œbut canâ€™t
we have post-horses?â€

â€œThey have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but
those absolutely requisite for posting.â€

â€œWhat are we to say to this?â€ asked Franz.

â€œI say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I am
accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is
supper ready, Signor Pastrini?â€

â€œYes, your excellency.â€

â€œWell, then, let us sup.â€

â€œBut the carriage and horses?â€ said Franz.

â€œBe easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a
question of how much shall be charged for them.â€ Morcerf then, with
that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to
a full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept
soundly, and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a
coach with six horses.



 Chapter 33. Roman Bandits

The next morning Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The
sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.

â€œWell, excellency,â€ said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting
for Franz to question him, â€œI feared yesterday, when I would not
promise you anything, that you were too lateâ€”there is not a single
carriage to be hadâ€”that is, for the three last daysâ€

â€œYes,â€ returned Franz, â€œfor the very three days it is most needed.â€

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ said Albert, entering; â€œno carriage to be had?â€

â€œJust so,â€ returned Franz, â€œyou have guessed it.â€

â€œWell, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.â€

â€œThat is to say, excellency,â€ replied Pastrini, who was desirous of
keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the
eyes of his guest, â€œthat there are no carriages to be had from Sunday
to Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you
please.â€

â€œAh, that is something,â€ said Albert; â€œtoday is Thursday, and who knows
what may arrive between this and Sunday?â€

â€œTen or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,â€ replied Franz, â€œwhich
will make it still more difficult.â€

â€œMy friend,â€ said Morcerf, â€œlet us enjoy the present without gloomy
forebodings for the future.â€

â€œAt least we can have a window?â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œIn the Corso.â€

â€œAh, a window!â€ exclaimed Signor Pastrini,â€”â€œutterly impossible; there
was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has
been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.â€

The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.

â€œWell,â€ said Franz to Albert, â€œdo you know what is the best thing we
can do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of
obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.â€

â€œAh, the devil, no,â€ cried Albert; â€œI came to Rome to see the Carnival,
and I will, though I see it on stilts.â€

â€œBravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster
pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete
success.â€

â€œDo your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday
morning?â€

â€œ_Parbleu!_â€ said Albert, â€œdo you think we are going to run about on
foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyersâ€™ clerks?â€

â€œI hasten to comply with your excellenciesâ€™ wishes; only, I tell you
beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.â€

â€œAnd, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next
apartments,â€ said Franz, â€œI warn you, that as I have been four times
before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give
you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then
you will make a good profit.â€

â€œBut, excellencyâ€â€”said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.

â€œNow go,â€ returned Franz, â€œor I shall go myself and bargain with your
_affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has
plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out
of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will
lose the preference, and that will be your fault.â€

â€œDo not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,â€ returned Signor
Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he
confesses defeat; â€œI will do all I can, and I hope you will be
satisfied.â€

â€œAnd now we understand each other.â€

â€œWhen do you wish the carriage to be here?â€

â€œIn an hour.â€

â€œIn an hour it will be at the door.â€

An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance
which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the
occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would
have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three
days of the Carnival.

â€œExcellency,â€ cried the _cicerone_, seeing Franz approach the window,
â€œshall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?â€

Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse
was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz was
the â€œexcellency,â€ the vehicle was the â€œcarriage,â€ and the HÃ´tel de
Londres was the â€œpalace.â€ The genius for laudation characteristic of
the race was in that phrase.

Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their
excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the _cicerone_
sprang into the seat behind.

â€œWhere do your excellencies wish to go?â€ asked he.

â€œTo Saint Peterâ€™s first, and then to the Colosseum,â€ returned Albert.
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peterâ€™s, and a
month to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peterâ€™s alone.

Suddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watchâ€”it
was half-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz
ordered the coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the
Colosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peterâ€™s by daylight.
When we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same
pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.

He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall,
and re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the
Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on
the Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of
Antoninus and Faustina, and the Via Sacra.

They sat down to dinner. Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet;
he gave them a tolerable repast. At the end of the dinner he entered in
person. Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and
began accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted.

â€œExcellency,â€ said Pastrini, â€œI am delighted to have your approbation,
but it was not for that I came.â€

â€œDid you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?â€ asked Albert,
lighting his cigar.

â€œNo; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any
longer; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told
anything cannot be done, there is an end of it.â€

â€œIt is much more convenient at Paris,â€”when anything cannot be done, you
pay double, and it is done directly.â€

â€œThat is what all the French say,â€ returned Signor Pastrini, somewhat
piqued; â€œfor that reason, I do not understand why they travel.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair
on its hind legs, â€œonly madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their
walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the CafÃ© de Paris.â€

It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street,
appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the
only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good
terms with its waiters.

Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he
was musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.

â€œBut,â€ said Franz, in his turn interrupting his hostâ€™s meditations,
â€œyou had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know what it was?â€

20099m



â€œAh, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight oâ€™clock precisely?â€

â€œI have.â€

â€œYou intend visiting _Il Colosseo_.â€

â€œYou mean the Colosseum?â€

â€œIt is the same thing. You have told your coachman to leave the city by
the Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the
Porta San Giovanni?â€

â€œThese are my words exactly.â€

â€œWell, this route is impossible.â€

â€œImpossible!â€

â€œVery dangerous, to say the least.â€

â€œDangerous!â€”and why?â€

â€œOn account of the famous Luigi Vampa.â€

â€œPray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?â€ inquired Albert; â€œhe may be
very famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite unknown at
Paris.â€

â€œWhat! do you not know him?â€

â€œI have not that honor.â€

â€œYou have never heard his name?â€

â€œNever.â€

â€œWell, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the
Gasparones were mere children.â€

â€œNow then, Albert,â€ cried Franz, â€œhere is a bandit for you at last.â€

â€œI forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word of
what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin. â€˜Once upon
a timeâ€”â€”â€™ Well, go on.â€

Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more
reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,â€”he had had a great many
Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.

â€œExcellency,â€ said he gravely, addressing Franz, â€œif you look upon me
as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your
interest Iâ€”â€”â€

â€œAlbert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,â€ said Franz, â€œbut
that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,â€”but I will
believe all you say; so proceed.â€

â€œBut if your excellency doubt my veracityâ€”â€”â€

â€œSignor Pastrini,â€ returned Franz, â€œyou are more susceptible than
Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while
you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience. Come,
sit down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.â€

â€œI had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had
since the days of Mastrilla.â€

â€œWell, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the
coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by
the Porta San Giovanni?â€

20101m



â€œThis,â€ replied Signor Pastrini, â€œthat you will go out by one, but I
very much doubt your returning by the other.â€

â€œWhy?â€ asked Franz.

â€œBecause, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the
gates.â€

â€œOn your honor, is that true?â€ cried Albert.

â€œCount,â€ returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albertâ€™s repeated doubts of
the truth of his assertions, â€œI do not say this to you, but to your
companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to
be laughed at.â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ said Albert, turning to Franz, â€œhere is an admirable
adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and
double-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take himâ€”we
bring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who
asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a
carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,
and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and
proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their
country.â€

Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastriniâ€™s face assumed an
expression impossible to describe.

â€œAnd pray,â€ asked Franz, â€œwhere are these pistols, blunderbusses, and
other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?â€

â€œNot out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my
hunting-knife. And you?â€

â€œI shared the same fate at Aquapendente.â€

â€œDo you know, Signor Pastrini,â€ said Albert, lighting a second cigar at
the first, â€œthat this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that
it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.â€

Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he
only answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the
only one likely to listen with attention. â€œYour excellency knows that
it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.â€

â€œWhat!â€ cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being
plundered tamely, â€œnot make any resistance!â€

â€œNo, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen bandits
who spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces
at you?â€

â€œEh, _parbleu!_â€”they should kill me.â€

The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, â€œYour
friend is decidedly mad.â€

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ returned Franz, â€œyour answer is sublime, and worthy
the â€˜_Let him die_,â€™ of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer,
the safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify
a whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a
motive.â€

Albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped
at intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.

â€œWell, Signor Pastrini,â€ said Franz, â€œnow that my companion is quieted,
and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this
Luigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?â€”young or old?â€”tall or
short? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like Jean
Sbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.â€

â€œYou could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these
points, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell
into his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,
recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a
present of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.â€

â€œLet us see the watch,â€ said Albert.

Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent BrÃ©guet, bearing the
name of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a countâ€™s coronet.

â€œHere it is,â€ said he.

â€œ_Peste!_â€ returned Albert, â€œI compliment you on it; I have its
fellowâ€â€”he took his watch from his waistcoat pocketâ€”â€œand it cost me
3,000 francs.â€

â€œLet us hear the history,â€ said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to
seat himself.

â€œYour excellencies permit it?â€ asked the host.

â€œ_Pardieu!_â€ cried Albert, â€œyou are not a preacher, to remain
standing!â€

The host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,
which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know
concerning Luigi Vampa.

â€œYou tell me,â€ said Franz, at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to
open his mouth, â€œthat you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a childâ€”he is
still a young man, then?â€

â€œA young man? he is only two-and-twenty;â€”he will gain himself a
reputation.â€

â€œWhat do you think of that, Albert?â€”at two-and-twenty to be thus
famous?â€

â€œYes, and at his age, Alexander, CÃ¦sar, and Napoleon, who have all made
some noise in the world, were quite behind him.â€

â€œSo,â€ continued Franz, â€œthe hero of this history is only
two-and-twenty?â€

â€œScarcely so much.â€

â€œIs he tall or short?â€

â€œOf the middle heightâ€”about the same stature as his excellency,â€
returned the host, pointing to Albert.

â€œThanks for the comparison,â€ said Albert, with a bow.

â€œGo on, Signor Pastrini,â€ continued Franz, smiling at his friendâ€™s
susceptibility. â€œTo what class of society does he belong?â€

â€œHe was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,
situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at
Pampinara, and entered the countâ€™s service when he was five years old;
his father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by
the wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the
little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he
was seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to
be taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his
flock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little
hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was
called Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and
that then he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be
short, and that he must profit as much as possible by it. The child
accepted joyfully. Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road
that leads from Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine oâ€™clock in the
morning, the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and
the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priestâ€™s breviary. At
the end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enoughâ€”he
must now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make
three alphabetsâ€”one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out
to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the
letters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the
flock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at
Palestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a
sort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of
slate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.
The curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a
present of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but
nothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well
with this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to
the Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him
read and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with
the domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi
purchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to
everything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,
houses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of
objects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had
commenced.

20105m



â€œA girl of six or sevenâ€”that is, a little younger than Vampaâ€”tended
sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone
and was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,
let their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed
together; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Feliceâ€™s flock
from those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their
respective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they
kept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and
Teresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.
Beside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as
he could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness
and enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.
None of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able
to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His
disposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make
them) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a
look, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded
beneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might
have broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and
gay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received
every month from the Count of San-Feliceâ€™s steward, and the price of
all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in
ear-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her
friendâ€™s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired
peasant near Rome.

â€œThe two children grew up together, passing all their time with each
other, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different
characters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their
conversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an
army, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly
attired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they
had thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated
their flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the
reality of their humble position.

â€œOne day the young shepherd told the countâ€™s steward that he had seen a
wolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The
steward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an
excellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the
precision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,
and had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a
sculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what
change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a
fresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen
or twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be
farther from his thoughts.

â€œFor a long time a gun had been the young manâ€™s greatest ambition. In
every country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the
first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once
renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner
terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all
his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious
weapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a
markâ€”the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the
Sabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding
excursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon
became so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at
the report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever
he pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.

20107m



â€œOne evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were
usually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he
was dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his
shoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi
considerable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds
admirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the
strongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around;
and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful
girl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it
was known that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people
had never declared their affection; they had grown together like two
trees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose
intermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each
other had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a
dayâ€™s separation.

â€œTeresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of
brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to
be much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from
the neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief
presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.

â€œThe celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the
kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed
the Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the
Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of
followers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom
he hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and
Pampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much
disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.
After some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the
most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were
related of him.

â€œOne day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of
Frosinone. The banditâ€™s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first
to him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is
abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When
their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is
sent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the
messenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably
lost. The young girlâ€™s lover was in Cucumettoâ€™s troop; his name was
Carlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms
to him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for
he but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a
favorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served
him, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about
to cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took
Cucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge
pine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her
picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the
bandits. There he told the chief allâ€”his affection for the prisoner,
their promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had
been near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.

20109m



â€œIt so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a
village, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.
Cucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had
carried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception
in Ritaâ€™s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.
Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friendâ€™s entreaties, and bade him find
a shepherd to send to Ritaâ€™s father at Frosinone.

â€œCarlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding
her write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her
ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hoursâ€™ delay was all
that was grantedâ€”that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the
letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to
find a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The
natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between
the city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy
undertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an
hour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the
joyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the
provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye
vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.

â€œHe inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.
A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.
He repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a
glass filled with Orvietto, saying, â€˜To the health of the brave
Cucumetto and the fair Rita.â€™ At this moment Carlini heard a womanâ€™s
cry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face
of him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry
came. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he
found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,
Cucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each
other for a momentâ€”the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips,
the other with the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle
between the two men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carliniâ€™s features
relaxed, his hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt,
fell to his side. Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said Cucumetto, â€˜have you executed your commission?â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes, captain,â€™ returned Carlini. â€˜At nine oâ€™clock tomorrow Ritaâ€™s
father will be here with the money.â€™

â€œâ€˜It is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young
girl is charming, and does credit to your taste. Now, as I am not
egotistical, we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.â€™

â€œâ€˜You have determined, then, to abandon her to the common law?â€™ said
Carlini.

â€œâ€˜Why should an exception be made in her favor?â€™

â€œâ€˜I thought that my entreatiesâ€”â€”â€™

â€œâ€˜What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an
exception?â€™

â€œâ€˜It is true.â€™

â€œâ€˜But never mind,â€™ continued Cucumetto, laughing, â€˜sooner or later your
turn will come.â€™ Carliniâ€™s teeth clenched convulsively.

â€œâ€˜Now, then,â€™ said Cucumetto, advancing towards the other bandits, â€˜are
you coming?â€™

â€œâ€˜I follow you.â€™

20111m



â€œCucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for, doubtless,
he feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing betrayed a
hostile design on Carliniâ€™s part. He was standing, his arms folded,
near Rita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a moment the
young man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this mattered
little to him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three
hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he
cared little about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade;
but, to his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself.

â€œâ€˜Let us draw lots! let us draw lots!â€™ cried all the brigands, when
they saw the chief.

â€œTheir demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of
acquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,
and the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of
all, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the
band drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio. He
was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and
to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large
wound, extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.
Diavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud
laugh.

â€œâ€˜Captain,â€™ said he, â€˜just now Carlini would not drink your health when
I proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let us see if he will be
more condescending to you than to me.â€™

â€œEveryone expected an explosion on Carliniâ€™s part; but to their great
surprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and
filling it,â€”

â€œâ€˜Your health, Diavolaccio,â€™ said he calmly, and he drank it off,
without his hand trembling in the least. Then sitting down by the fire,
â€˜My supper,â€™ said he; â€˜my expedition has given me an appetite.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well done, Carlini!â€™ cried the brigands; â€˜that is acting like a good
fellow;â€™ and they all formed a circle round the fire, while Diavolaccio
disappeared.

â€œCarlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits looked
on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard
footsteps. They turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young
girl in his arms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the
ground. As they entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the
firelight, the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio.
This apparition was so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with
the exception of Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank
calmly. Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid
Rita at the captainâ€™s feet. Then everyone could understand the cause of
the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit. A knife was
plunged up to the hilt in Ritaâ€™s left breast. Everyone looked at
Carlini; the sheath at his belt was empty.

â€œâ€˜Ah, ah,â€™ said the chief, â€˜I now understand why Carlini stayed
behind.â€™

â€œAll savage natures appreciate a desperate deed. No other of the
bandits would, perhaps, have done the same; but they all understood
what Carlini had done.

â€œâ€˜Now, then,â€™ cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and approaching the
corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols, â€˜does anyone
dispute the possession of this woman with me?â€™

â€œâ€˜No,â€™ returned the chief, â€˜she is thine.â€™

â€œCarlini raised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle of
firelight. Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the
bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the
fire. At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all
were on the alert. It was Ritaâ€™s father, who brought his daughterâ€™s
ransom in person.

â€œâ€˜Here,â€™ said he, to Cucumetto, â€˜here are three hundred piastres; give
me back my child.

â€œBut the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him to follow.
The old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees, through whose
branches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at last, and pointed
to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.

â€œâ€˜There,â€™ said he, â€˜demand thy child of Carlini; he will tell thee what
has become of her;â€™ and he returned to his companions.

â€œThe old man remained motionless; he felt that some great and
unforeseen misfortune hung over his head. At length he advanced toward
the group, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. As he
approached, Carlini raised his head, and the forms of two persons
became visible to the old manâ€™s eyes. A woman lay on the ground, her
head resting on the knees of a man, who was seated by her; as he raised
his head, the womanâ€™s face became visible. The old man recognized his
child, and Carlini recognized the old man.

â€œâ€˜I expected thee,â€™ said the bandit to Ritaâ€™s father.

â€œâ€˜Wretch!â€™ returned the old man, â€˜what hast thou done?â€™ and he gazed
with terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife buried in her bosom. A
ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of
the dead.

â€œâ€˜Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,â€™ said the bandit; â€˜I loved her,
therefore I slew her; for she would have served as the sport of the
whole band.â€™ The old man spoke not, and grew pale as death. â€˜Now,â€™
continued Carlini, â€˜if I have done wrongly, avenge her;â€™ and
withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritaâ€™s bosom, he held it out to
the old man with one hand, while with the other he tore open his vest.

â€œâ€˜Thou hast done well!â€™ returned the old man in a hoarse voice;
â€˜embrace me, my son.â€™

20115m



Carlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his
mistressâ€™s father. These were the first tears the man of blood had ever
wept.

â€œâ€˜Now,â€™ said the old man, â€˜aid me to bury my child.â€™ Carlini fetched
two pickaxes; and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of
a huge oak, beneath which the young girl was to repose. When the grave
was formed, the father embraced her first, and then the lover;
afterwards, one taking the head, the other the feet, they placed her in
the grave. Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and said the
prayers of the dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the earth
over the corpse, until the grave was filled. Then, extending his hand,
the old man said; â€˜I thank you, my son; and now leave me alone.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yetâ€”â€”â€™ replied Carlini.

â€œâ€˜Leave me, I command you.â€™

â€œCarlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak,
and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved
the night before to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak,
Cucumetto aroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini
would not quit the forest, without knowing what had become of Ritaâ€™s
father. He went toward the place where he had left him. He found the
old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his
daughterâ€™s grave. He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the
dead body of the one and the tomb of the other. But he was unable to
complete this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the
Roman carbineers, Carlini was killed. There was some surprise, however,
that, as he was with his face to the enemy, he should have received a
ball between his shoulders. That astonishment ceased when one of the
brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten
paces in Carliniâ€™s rear when he fell. On the morning of the departure
from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness,
and heard this oath of vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.

â€œThey told ten other stories of this bandit chief, each more singular
than the other. Thus, from Fondi to Perusia, everyone trembles at the
name of Cucumetto.

â€œThese narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between
Luigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the
stories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his
good fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not
restore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,
took aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of
the tree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be
married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age.
They were both orphans, and had only their employersâ€™ leave to ask,
which had been already sought and obtained. One day when they were
talking over their plans for the future, they heard two or three
reports of firearms, and then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near
which the two young persons used to graze their flocks, and hurried
towards them. When he came within hearing, he exclaimed:

â€˜I am pursued; can you conceal me?â€™

â€œThey knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there is
an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and
the latter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a
word, hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their
grotto, drew it away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there,
in a retreat unknown to everyone, closed the stone upon him, and then
went and resumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four
carbineers, on horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of
them appeared to be looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged
a brigand prisoner by the neck. The three carbineers looked about
carefully on every side, saw the young peasants, and galloping up,
began to question them. They had seen no one.

â€œâ€˜That is very annoying,â€™ said the brigadier; for the man we are
looking for is the chief.â€™

â€œâ€˜Cucumetto?â€™ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ replied the brigadier; â€˜and as his head is valued at a thousand
Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had
helped us to catch him.â€™ The two young persons exchanged looks. The
brigadier had a momentâ€™s hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three
thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor
orphans who are going to be married.

â€œâ€˜Yes, it is very annoying,â€™ said Vampa; â€˜but we have not seen him.â€™

â€œThen the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but
in vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the
stone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he
had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and
guessed the subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of
Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and
he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them.
But Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when
she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with
this purse of gold.

â€œCucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand
instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she
was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing
several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.

â€œSeveral days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto. The
time of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a
grand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were
invited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked
permission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be
present amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball
was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter
Carmela, whom he adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of
Teresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the
ball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in
her hair, and gayest glass beads,â€”she was in the costume of the women
of Frascati. Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant
at holiday time. They both mingled, as they had leave to do, with the
servants and peasants.

â€œThe _festa_ was magnificent; not only was the villa brilliantly
illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the
trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the
terraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was
an orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped,
formed quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased.
Carmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered
with pearls, the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle
was of Turkey silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and
skirt were of cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of
her corset were of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one
as a woman of Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four
young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them
with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other
country in the world. They were attired as peasants of Albano,
Velletri, Civita-Castellana, and Sora. We need hardly add that these
peasant costumes, like those of the young women, were brilliant with
gold and jewels.

â€œCarmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
Carmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume
similar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice
pointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigiâ€™s arm in a group of
peasants.

â€œâ€˜Will you allow me, father?â€™ said Carmela.

â€œâ€˜Certainly,â€™ replied the count, â€˜are we not in Carnival time?â€™

â€œCarmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her, and
saying a few words to him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young
man looked, bowed in obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited
her to dance in a quadrille directed by the countâ€™s daughter. Teresa
felt a flush pass over her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not
refuse his assent. Luigi slowly relinquished Teresaâ€™s arm, which he had
held beneath his own, and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier,
took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic
quadrille. Certainly, in the eyes of an artist, the exact and strict
costume of Teresa had a very different character from that of Carmela
and her companions; and Teresa was frivolous and coquettish, and thus
the embroidery and muslins, the cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled
her, and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her
giddy brain.

â€œLuigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was
like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through
his whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and
her cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should
swoon; every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell
were ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened
timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as
Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that
his language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was
turning round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in
his ears ideas of murder and assassination. Then fearing that his
paroxysm might get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the
branch of a tree against which he was leaning, and with the other
convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his
belt, and which, unwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to
time.

â€œLuigi was jealous!

â€œHe felt that, influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition,
Teresa might escape him.

â€œThe young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered
herself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;
Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more
potent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all the
honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of
San-Feliceâ€™s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was
not jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome
cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where
Luigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had
glanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his
features were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn
from its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it
was almost tremblingly that she resumed her loverâ€™s arm. The quadrille
had been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for
a repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of
San-Felice besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.

â€œOne of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it
was impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had
disappeared.

â€œThe truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another
such trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed
Teresa toward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite
of herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the
young man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that
something strange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt
from internal emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet
fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she
did not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches
were merited.

â€œHowever, to Teresaâ€™s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not
a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the
night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the
villa were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa
quite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:

â€œâ€˜Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young
Countess of San-Felice?â€™

â€œâ€˜I thought,â€™ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her
nature, â€˜that I would give half my life for a costume such as she
wore.â€™

â€œâ€˜And what said your cavalier to you?â€™

â€œâ€˜He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had only one
word to say.â€™

â€œâ€˜He was right,â€™ said Luigi. â€˜Do you desire it as ardently as you say?â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well, then, you shall have it!â€™

â€œThe young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but
his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.
As Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes
into the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite
disappeared, she went into the house with a sigh.

20121m



â€œThat night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the
imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights.
The Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very
apartment of the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of
the flames, she sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown,
and attempted to escape by the door, but the corridor by which she
hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames. She then returned to her
room, calling for help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her
window, which was twenty feet from the ground, was opened, a young
peasant jumped into the chamber, seized her in his arms, and with
superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the
grass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her father was by
her side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her assistance. An
entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that, as long as
Carmela was safe and uninjured?

â€œHer preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was
inquired after, but no one had seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled
that she had not recognized him.

â€œAs the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had
run,â€”and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that
appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,â€”the
loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.

â€œThe next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the
borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in
high spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the
previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so
cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to
her when she was not excited or in a passion.

â€œLuigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the
grotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was
something extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly.

â€œâ€˜Teresa,â€™ said Luigi, â€˜yesterday evening you told me you would give
all the world to have a costume similar to that of the countâ€™s
daughter.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ replied Teresa with astonishment; â€˜but I was mad to utter such
a wish.â€™

â€œâ€˜And I replied, â€œVery well, you shall have it.â€â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every
word uttered by Luigi, â€˜but of course your reply was only to please
me.â€™

â€œâ€˜I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,â€™ said Luigi
proudly. â€˜Go into the grotto and dress yourself.â€™

â€œAt these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto,
lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid
mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl
necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the
rest of the costume.

â€œTeresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire
came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into
a dressing-room.

â€œLuigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small
adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a
traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road,
and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is
peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he
put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him.

â€œLuigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina
to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at
a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three
ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his
route, he begged Luigi to be his guide.

â€œLuigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his
shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller
with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep
up with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the
cross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an
emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the
traveller was to follow.

â€œâ€˜That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.â€™

â€œâ€˜And here is your recompense,â€™ said the traveller, offering the young
herdsman some small pieces of money.

â€œâ€˜Thank you,â€™ said Luigi, drawing back his hand; â€˜I render a service, I
do not sell it.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ replied the traveller, who seemed used to this difference
between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the
mountaineer, â€˜if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.â€™

â€œâ€˜Ah, yes, that is another thing.â€™

â€œâ€˜Then,â€™ said the traveller, â€˜take these two Venetian sequins and give
them to your bride, to make herself a pair of earrings.â€™

â€œâ€˜And then do you take this poniard,â€™ said the young herdsman; â€˜you
will not find one better carved between Albano and Civita-Castellana.â€™

â€œâ€˜I accept it,â€™ answered the traveller, â€˜but then the obligation will
be on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.â€™

â€œâ€˜For a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it is
hardly worth a piastre.â€™

â€œâ€˜What is your name?â€™ inquired the traveller.

â€œâ€˜Luigi Vampa,â€™ replied the shepherd, with the same air as he would
have replied, Alexander, King of Macedon. â€˜And yours?â€™

â€œâ€˜I,â€™ said the traveller, â€˜am called Sinbad the Sailor.â€™â€

Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay started with surprise.

â€œSinbad the Sailor?â€ he said.

â€œYes,â€ replied the narrator; â€œthat was the name which the traveller
gave to Vampa as his own.â€

â€œWell, and what may you have to say against this name?â€ inquired
Albert; â€œit is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman
of that name amused me very much in my youth, I must confess.â€

Franz said no more. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be
supposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of
the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening.

â€œProceed!â€ said he to the host.

â€œVampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly
returned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred
paces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know
whence this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he
heard his own name pronounced distinctly.

â€œThe cry proceeded from the grotto. He bounded like a chamois, cocking
his carbine as he went, and in a moment reached the summit of a hill
opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller. Three cries
for help came more distinctly to his ear. He cast his eyes around him
and saw a man carrying off Teresa, as Nessus, the centaur, carried
Deianira.

â€œThis man, who was hastening towards the wood, was already
three-quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest.
Vampa measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in
advance of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him. The young
shepherd stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he
put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher,
followed him for a second in his track, and then fired.

â€œThe ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he fell
with Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose instantly, but the man lay
on the earth struggling in the agonies of death. Vampa then rushed
towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed
her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared
that the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his
betrothed.

â€œFortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had
overcome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and
unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He had just expired, with
clenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in
the sweat of death. His eyes remained open and menacing. Vampa
approached the corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.

â€œFrom the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young
peasants, he had been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be
his. From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment
when her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he
at length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring
skill of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him
for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the
contrary, Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the
slain ruffian but by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead
body over the shoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his
mistress:

â€œâ€˜Ah,â€™ said heâ€”â€˜good, good! You are dressed; it is now my turn to dress
myself.â€™

20125m



â€œTeresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of
San-Feliceâ€™s daughter. Vampa took Cucumettoâ€™s body in his arms and
conveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.
If a second traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,â€”a
shepherdess watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with
ear-rings and necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of
sapphires, emeralds, and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that
he had returned to the times of Florian, and would have declared, on
reaching Paris, that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the
foot of the Sabine Hill.

â€œAt the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto; his
costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore a vest of
garnet-colored velvet, with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat
covered with embroidery; a Roman scarf tied round his neck; a
cartridge-box worked with gold, and red and green silk; sky-blue velvet
breeches, fastened above the knee with diamond buckles; garters of
deerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques, and a hat whereon hung
ribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his girdle, and a splendid
poniard was in his belt.

â€œTeresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a
painting by LÃ©opold Robert or Schnetz. He had assumed the entire
costume of Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect produced on his
betrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his lips.

â€œâ€˜Now,â€™ he said to Teresa, â€˜are you ready to share my fortune, whatever
it may be?â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, yes!â€™ exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.

â€œâ€˜And follow me wherever I go?â€™

â€œâ€˜To the worldâ€™s end.â€™

â€œâ€˜Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.â€™

â€œThe young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was
conducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,
proud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon
entered it.

â€œWe need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to
Vampa; he therefore went forward without a momentâ€™s hesitation,
although there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at
the trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an
hour and a half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest
part of the forest. A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep
gorge. Vampa took this wild road, which, enclosed between two ridges,
and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the
difficulties of its descent, that path to Avernus of which Virgil
speaks. Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the
plain around her, and pressed closely against her guide, not uttering a
syllable; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed
countenance, she endeavored to repress her emotion.

â€œSuddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree
and aimed at Vampa.

â€œâ€˜Not another step,â€™ he said, â€˜or you are a dead man.â€™

â€œâ€˜What, then,â€™ said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain,
while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to
him, â€˜do wolves rend each other?â€™

â€œâ€˜Who are you?â€™ inquired the sentinel.

â€œâ€˜I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.â€™

â€œâ€˜What do you want?â€™

â€œâ€˜I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca
Bianca.â€™

â€œâ€˜Follow me, then,â€™ said the sentinel; â€˜or, as you know your way, go
first.â€™

â€œVampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the
bandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm
and easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them
a sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice
imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.

â€œâ€˜Good!â€™ said the sentry, â€˜you may now go on.â€™

â€œLuigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung
tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of
carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top
of a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a
volcanoâ€”an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had
deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome.

â€œTeresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves
in the presence of twenty bandits.

â€œâ€˜Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,â€™ said the
sentinel.

â€œâ€˜What has he to say?â€™ inquired the young man who was in command in the
chiefâ€™s absence.

â€œâ€˜I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherdâ€™s life,â€™ was Vampaâ€™s
reply.

â€œâ€˜Ah, I understand,â€™ said the lieutenant; â€˜and you seek admittance into
our ranks?â€™

â€œâ€˜Welcome!â€™ cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and
Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.

â€œâ€˜Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.â€™

â€œâ€˜And what may that be?â€™ inquired the bandits with astonishment.

â€œâ€˜I come to ask to be your captain,â€™ said the young man.

â€œThe bandits shouted with laughter.

â€œâ€˜And what have you done to aspire to this honor?â€™ demanded the
lieutenant.

â€œâ€˜I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I
set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my
betrothed.â€™

â€œAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto,
deceased.â€

20129m



â€œWell, my dear Albert,â€ said Franz, turning towards his friend; â€œwhat
think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?â€

â€œI say he is a myth,â€ replied Albert, â€œand never had an existence.â€

â€œAnd what may a myth be?â€ inquired Pastrini.

â€œThe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,â€ replied Franz.

â€œAnd you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment
in the environs of Rome?â€

â€œAnd with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an
example.â€

â€œThen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?â€

â€œWhy, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the
plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.
They seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they
follow him on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue
him, and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio,
Giannutri, or Monte Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he
reappears suddenly at Albano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.â€

â€œAnd how does he behave towards travellers?â€

â€œAlas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be
from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day
wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows
another hourâ€™s grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money
is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisonerâ€™s brains with a
pistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the
account.â€

â€œWell, Albert,â€ inquired Franz of his companion, â€œare you still
disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?â€

â€œQuite so,â€ said Albert, â€œif the way be picturesque.â€

The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.

â€œExcellencies,â€ said he, â€œthe coach is ready.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said Franz, â€œlet us to the Colosseum.â€

â€œBy the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?â€

â€œBy the streets, _morbleu!_ by the streets!â€ cried Franz.

â€œAh, my dear fellow,â€ said Albert, rising, and lighting his third
cigar, â€œreally, I thought you had more courage.â€

So saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the
carriage.

20131m




 Chapter 34. The Colosseum

Franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum
they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary
impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the
gigantic building they came to admire. The road selected was a
continuation of the Via Sistina; then by cutting off the right angle of
the street in which stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the
Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli, the travellers would find
themselves directly opposite the Colosseum.

This itinerary possessed another great advantage,â€”that of leaving Franz
at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor
Pastriniâ€™s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so
strangely mixed up. Seated with folded arms in a corner of the
carriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so
lately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of
questions touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving
at a satisfactory reply to any of them.

One fact more than the rest brought his friend â€œSinbad the Sailorâ€ back
to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that
seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastriniâ€™s
account of Vampaâ€™s having found refuge on board the vessels of
smugglers and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he
had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which
had even deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the
sole purpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of
Monte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the HÃ´tel de
Londres, abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing
his philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia,
Ostia, and GaÃ«ta, as on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and
further, Franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer
speak both of Tunis and Palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle
of acquaintances extended.

But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these
reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark
frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various
openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the
unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage
stopped near the Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men,
eagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared
to have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.

The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two
conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply
of guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you
directly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you
remain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to
each monumentâ€”nay, almost to each part of a monument. It may,
therefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the
Colosseum, that wonder of all ages, which Martial thus eulogizes:

â€œLet Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and
the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to
the superiority of the gigantic labor of the CÃ¦sars, and the many
voices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this
incomparable monument.â€

As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their
_ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more
difficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to
visit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the
young men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly
surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.

Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the
Colosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in
his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;
and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity
of the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic
admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these
stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and
more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the
building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a
southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to
light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western
clime.

Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps
beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to
the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of
carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as
regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the
various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,
beginning, as a matter of course, with the â€œLionsâ€™ Denâ€, the â€œHall of
the Gladiatorsâ€ and finishing with â€œCÃ¦sarâ€™s Podiumâ€), to escape a
jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded,
Franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to
follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,
and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy
a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic
ruin.

Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by
the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a
resting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert
and his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a
vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again
disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the
Vestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades
following the flickering glare of so many _ignes fatui_. All at once
his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the
staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended. There was
nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving
way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance
that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that
someone, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps
from being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.

Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was
distinctly visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase
opposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of
silvery brightness.

The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like
Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the
frivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing
extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded,
stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took,
convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person.

By a sort of instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible
behind his pillar.

About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof
had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be
seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.

Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free
entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile,
grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood
out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while
large masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through
the chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.

The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of
Franz stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to
distinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out. He
wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left
shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance,
while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat.
The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright
rays of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed
their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished
leather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.

20135m



From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to
one conclusion,â€”that the person whom he was thus watching certainly
belonged to no inferior station of life.

Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest
signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture
in the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct
the flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was
clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath
him; then, as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a
floating mass of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help
to within three or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on
his feet. The man who had performed this daring act with so much
indifference wore the Transtevere costume.

â€œI beg your excellencyâ€™s pardon for keeping you waiting,â€ said the man,
in the Roman dialect, â€œbut I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m many minutes after my
time, ten oâ€™clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran.â€

â€œSay not a word about being late,â€ replied the stranger in purest
Tuscan; â€œâ€™tis I who am too soon. But even if you had caused me to wait
a little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not
occasioned by any fault of yours.â€

â€œYour excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,â€ said the man; â€œI
came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense
deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.â€

â€œAnd who is Beppo?â€

â€œOh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to
let me know what is going on within his holinessâ€™s castle.â€

â€œIndeed! You are a provident person, I see.â€

â€œWhy, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these days
I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some
little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out
of prison.â€

â€œBriefly, what did you learn?â€

â€œThat two executions of considerable interest will take place the day
after tomorrow at two oâ€™clock, as is customary at Rome at the
commencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be
_mazzolato_;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who
brought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer
is sentenced to be _decapitato_;4 and he, your excellency, is poor
Peppino.â€

â€œThe fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical
government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear,
that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.â€

â€œBut Peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor
shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.â€

â€œWhich makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But mark
the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on
the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply
sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the
day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every
spectator.â€

â€œWithout reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise
them with.â€

â€œMy good friend,â€ said the man in the cloak, â€œexcuse me for saying that
you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant
act.â€

â€œPerhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop
at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this
scrape solely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself
as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.â€

â€œAnd what do you mean to do?â€

â€œTo surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal
from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution,
and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and
carry off the prisoner.â€

â€œThat seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my
scheme is far better than yours.â€

â€œAnd what is your excellencyâ€™s project?â€

â€œJust this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the
person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for
Peppino; and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres
will afford him the means of escaping from his prison.â€

â€œAnd do you feel sure of succeeding?â€

â€œ_Pardieu!_â€ exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing
himself in French.

â€œWhat did your excellency say?â€ inquired the other.

â€œI said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the
means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,
pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act,
and have no fears for the result.â€

â€œAt least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness,
in case your excellency should fail.â€

â€œNone whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any
satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I
seek.â€

â€œRemember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that
you have but one day to work in.â€

â€œAnd what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each
hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty
seconds? Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.â€

â€œAnd how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.â€

â€œOh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower
windows at the CafÃ© Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite
pardon for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow
damasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked
on it.â€

â€œAnd whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer
directing the execution?â€

â€œSend one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will give
it to him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the
scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer,
who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it
will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if
it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because
in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.â€

â€œYour excellency,â€ said the man, â€œyou are fully persuaded of my entire
devotion to you, are you not?â€

â€œNay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,â€ replied the
cavalier in the cloak.

â€œWell, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and
henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute
obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can
render to another.â€

â€œHave a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may
remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period,
when I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.â€

â€œLet that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what I
have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of
the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may
regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith ofâ€”â€”â€

â€œHush!â€ interrupted the stranger; â€œI hear a noise.â€

â€œâ€™Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight.â€

â€œâ€™Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing
but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be
honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our
intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit
would suffer thereby.â€

â€œWell, then, if you obtain the reprieve?â€

â€œThe middle window at the CafÃ© Rospoli will be hung with white damask,
bearing a red cross.â€

â€œAnd if you fail?â€

â€œThen all three windows will have yellow draperies.â€

â€œAnd then?â€

â€œAnd then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and
I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.â€

â€œWe understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;
depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.â€

Saying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase,
while his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in
the folds of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to
the arena by an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard
himself called by Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the
sound of his friendâ€™s name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons
till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he
had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering
them in his descent. In ten minutes after the strangers had departed,
Franz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied
indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the
manner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to
prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.

Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear
what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that
had occurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the
Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger
to him, but not so the other; and though Franz had been unable to
distinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle
or obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful
an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever
again to forget them, hear them when or where he might. It was more
especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half
bitter, that Franzâ€™s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet
well-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte
Cristo, and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and
ruined grandeur of the Colosseum. And the more he thought, the more
entire was his conviction, that the person who wore the mantle was no
other than his former host and entertainer, â€œSinbad the Sailor.â€

20139m



Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to
resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage,
and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but
in the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he
had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at
such a time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen,
therefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a
recognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his
present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.

In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which
assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber
refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish
contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the
identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the
inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the
firmer grew his opinion on the subject.

Worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till
late. Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in
arranging for the eveningâ€™s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at
the Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,
relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.

At five oâ€™clock Albert returned, delighted with his dayâ€™s work; he had
been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received
in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible
for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the
remarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had accomplished
what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to
effect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to
be played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers
appeared in it. The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for
representation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La
Specchia.

The young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate
in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the
composer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_, supported by three of the most
renowned vocalists of Italy.

Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their
orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of
balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who
had had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the
Opera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and
effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his
elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy
representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the
mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting
with a single adventure.

Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success;
but internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely
piqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most
sought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed
over, and merely have his labor for his pains. And the thing was so
much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of
a Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he
had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that
upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital
of his numerous love-affairs.

Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his
way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all
faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and
thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de
Morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies
of Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are
faithful even in their infidelity.

Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there
might be an exception to the general rule.

Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also
possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a
viscountâ€”a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it
is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a
genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or
merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf
commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to
render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was
therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the
principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling
observation.

Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and
indifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the
different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated,
Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual
rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this
time of liberty and relaxation. The Carnival was to commence on the
morrow; therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth
the programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.

With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of
the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by
the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet. The box taken by Albert
was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is
deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled
the â€œnobilityâ€™s boxes,â€ and although the box engaged for the two
friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons,
it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for
one admitting merely four occupants.

Another motive had influenced Albertâ€™s selection of his seat,â€”who knew
but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the
notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would
procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely
balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?

These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to
please than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of
the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing
the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but,
alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity
had been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely
creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all
so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts,
that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his
glass.

The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the
â€œHoly Weekâ€ that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to
prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the
stage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought
of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly
cease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to
listen to some brilliant effort of Morianiâ€™s, a well-executed
recitative by Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful
powers of La Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly
relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting
conversation.

Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been
hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been
introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The
quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend
beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily:

â€œDo you know the woman who has just entered that box?â€

â€œYes; what do you think of her?â€

â€œOh, she is perfectly lovelyâ€”what a complexion! And such magnificent
hair! Is she French?â€

â€œNo; a Venetian.â€

â€œAnd her name isâ€”â€”â€

â€œCountess Gâ€”â€”.â€

â€œAh, I know her by name!â€ exclaimed Albert; â€œshe is said to possess as
much wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been presented to her
when I met her at Madame Villefortâ€™s ball.â€

â€œShall I assist you in repairing your negligence?â€ asked Franz.

â€œMy dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to
venture to take me to her box?â€

â€œWhy, I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing
with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an
acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.â€

At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her
hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the
head. â€œUpon my word,â€ said Albert, â€œyou seem to be on excellent terms
with the beautiful countess.â€

â€œYou are mistaken in thinking so,â€ returned Franz calmly; â€œbut you
merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen
to commit the most egregious blunders,â€”I mean that of judging the
habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe
me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree
of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar
terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant
between ourselves and the countessâ€”nothing more.â€

â€œIs there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of
heart?â€

â€œNo; of taste,â€ continued Franz gravely.

â€œAnd in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?â€

â€œBy the countessâ€™s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last night, by
moonlight, and nearly alone.â€

â€œYou were with her, then?â€

â€œI was.â€

â€œAnd what did you say to her?â€

â€œOh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is
a glorious monument!â€

â€œUpon my word,â€ cried Albert, â€œyou must have been a very entertaining
companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a
place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to
talk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a
chance, the living should be my theme.â€

20143m



â€œAnd you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, â€œnever mind the
past; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep your
promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?â€

â€œCertainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.â€

â€œWhat a confounded long time this first act lasts. I believe, on my
soul, that they never mean to finish it.â€

â€œOh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How
exquisitely Coselli sings his part.â€

â€œBut what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.â€

â€œWell, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see anything
more perfect than her acting?â€

â€œWhy, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to
Malibran and Sontag, such singers as these donâ€™t make the same
impression on you they perhaps do on others.â€

â€œAt least, you must admire Morianiâ€™s style and execution.â€

â€œI never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a
voice like a womanâ€™s.â€

â€œMy good friend,â€ said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to
point his glass at every box in the theatre, â€œyou seem determined not
to approve; you are really too difficult to please.â€

The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite
satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly
passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and
wristbands, and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead
the way.

Franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her
a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to
retard the gratification of Albertâ€™s eager impatience, but began at
once the tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed
himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the
theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to
arrange the lappets of his coat. This important task was just completed
as they arrived at the countessâ€™s box.

At the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who
was seated beside the countess, in obedience to the Italian custom,
instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in
turn, would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.

Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of
the day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary
talents; nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the
circle in which the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a
model of perfection. Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at
having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess
during her sojourn in Paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and
had requested him (Franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting
him to her box, and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in
having taken it upon himself to do so.

The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her
hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the
vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if
he wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own
chair.

Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian
matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew
there. Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and,
unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up
Albertâ€™s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.

Sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated
on the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek
costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore
it, was her national attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the
outline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter
personage it was not possible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear
breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing
between the countess and Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew
who was the fair Albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well
worthy of being observed by either sex.

â€œAll I can tell about her,â€ replied the countess, â€œis, that she has
been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her where she
now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has
never missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the person
who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black
servant.â€

â€œAnd what do you think of her personal appearance?â€

â€œOh, I consider her perfectly lovelyâ€”she is just my idea of what Medora
must have been.â€

Franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed
her conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous
survey of the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which
was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably
arranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself
a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the
choreographic artâ€”one of those masterly productions of grace, method,
and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_, from the principal
dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at
the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting
the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous
movement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of
volition, influenced the moving mass.

The ballet was called _Poliska_.

However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too
deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while
she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it,
her eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter
indifference of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece
lasted, never even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din
produced by the trumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their
loudest from the orchestra. Of this he took no heed, but was, as far as
appearances might be trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial
dreams.

The ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the
loud, unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.

Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera
with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the
singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their
costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their
pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.

The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the
leaderâ€™s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise
and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to
him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she
became as absorbed as before in what was going on.

The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so
completely in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could
not distinguish a single feature. The curtain rose, and the attention
of Franz was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box
containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the
business of the stage.

Most of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens
with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while
sleeping, betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured
husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction
seizes on his mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he
awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to
threaten her with his vengeance.

This duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible
conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.
Franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly
expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give
vent to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul
of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it.
Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience,
and was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed;
but suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and
the half-uttered â€œbravosâ€ expired on his lips.

The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share
the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand
up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had
no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte
Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding
evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had
seemed so familiar to him.

All doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host
evidently resided at Rome. The surprise and agitation occasioned by
this full confirmation of Franzâ€™s former suspicion had no doubt
imparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess,
after gazing with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of
laughter, and begged to know what had happened.

â€œCountess,â€ returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery, â€œI asked
you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the
Albanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me who and
what is her husband?â€

â€œNay,â€ answered the countess, â€œI know no more of him than yourself.â€

â€œPerhaps you never before noticed him?â€

â€œWhat a questionâ€”so truly French! Do you not know that we Italians have
eyes only for the man we love?â€

â€œTrue,â€ replied Franz.

â€œAll I can say is,â€ continued the countess, taking up the _lorgnette_,
and directing it toward the box in question, â€œthat the gentleman, whose
history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been
dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly
grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of
ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!â€

â€œOh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,â€ said Franz.

â€œThen you know him?â€ almost screamed the countess. â€œOh, pray do, for
heavenâ€™s sake, tell us all aboutâ€”is he a vampire, or a resuscitated
corpse, or what?â€

â€œI fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.â€

â€œAnd I can well understand,â€ said the countess, shrugging up her
beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through
her veins, â€œthat those who have once seen that man will never be likely
to forget him.â€

The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to
himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same
unaccountable awe and misgiving.

â€œWell.â€ inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time directed
her _lorgnette_ at the box, â€œwhat do you think of our opposite
neighbor?â€

20147m



â€œWhy, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.â€

This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzâ€™s countenance;
although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce
belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a
man as the mysterious personage before him.

â€œI must positively find out who and what he is,â€ said Franz, rising
from his seat.

â€œNo, no,â€ cried the countess; â€œyou must not leave me. I depend upon you
to escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.â€

â€œIs it possible,â€ whispered Franz, â€œthat you entertain any fear?â€

â€œIâ€™ll tell you,â€ answered the countess. â€œByron had the most perfect
belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me that he had
seen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the
features and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact
personification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,
large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems
burning,â€”the same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the woman
with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a
foreignerâ€”a stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes from.
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like
himself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near
himâ€”at least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as
great, pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can
nor shall. For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.â€

Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day,
for many reasons.

â€œListen to me,â€ said the countess, â€œand do not be so very headstrong. I
am going home. I have a party at my house tonight, and therefore cannot
possibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I cannot for one
instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your
escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.â€

There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat,
open the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite
evident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz
himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadâ€”so much the
stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative
recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an
instinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales
she had listened to till she believed them truths. Franz could even
feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage. Upon
arriving at her hotel, Franz perceived that she had deceived him when
she spoke of expecting company; on the contrary, her own return before
the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants.

â€œExcuse my little subterfuge,â€ said the countess, in reply to her
companionâ€™s half-reproachful observation on the subject; â€œbut that
horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be
alone, that I might compose my startled mind.â€

Franz essayed to smile.

â€œNay,â€ said she, â€œdo not smile; it ill accords with the expression of
your countenance, and I am sure it does not spring from your heart.
However, promise me one thing.â€

â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œPromise me, I say.â€

â€œI will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination of
finding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine
for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is
going.â€

â€œWhere he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where he
is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.â€

â€œLet us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,â€ said Franz.

â€œWell, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to your
hotel, and make no attempt to follow this man tonight. There are
certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet
afterwards. For heavenâ€™s sake, do not serve as a conductor between that
man and me. Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you
please; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of
terror. And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away
all recollections of this evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I
shall not be able to close my eyes.â€

So saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide
whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her
fears and agitations were genuine.

Upon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown
and slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.

â€œMy dear fellow!â€ cried he, springing up, â€œis it really you? Why, I did
not expect to see you before tomorrow.â€

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ replied Franz, â€œI am glad of this opportunity to tell
you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion
concerning Italian women. I should have thought the continual failures
you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you
better by this time.â€

â€œUpon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them
aright. Why, hereâ€”they give you their handâ€”they press yours in
returnâ€”they keep up a whispering conversationâ€”permit you to accompany
them home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these
marks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.â€

â€œAnd the very reason why the women of this fine country, â€˜where sounds
the _si_,â€™ as Dante writes, put so little restraint on their words and
actions, is because they live so much in public, and have really
nothing to conceal. Besides, you must have perceived that the countess
was really alarmed.â€

â€œAt what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite
to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my part, I
met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me,
if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I
can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking
fellowâ€”admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of
his clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailorâ€”probably Blin
or Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know,
paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic
descent and distinguished breeding.â€

Franz smiled; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided
himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion.

â€œWell, that tends to confirm my own ideas,â€ said Franz, â€œthat the
countessâ€™s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. Did he
speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?â€

â€œI did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that from
the mixture of Greek words. I donâ€™t know whether I ever told you that
when I was at college I was ratherâ€”rather strong in Greek.â€

â€œHe spoke the Romaic language, did he?â€

â€œI think so.â€

â€œThat settles it,â€ murmured Franz. â€œâ€™Tis he, past all doubt.â€

â€œWhat do you say?â€

â€œNothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I
came in?â€

â€œOh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.â€

â€œIndeed. Of what nature?â€

â€œWhy, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.â€

â€œCertainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means
afforded to endeavor to get one.â€

â€œNow, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my
brain.â€

Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the
suggestions of his imagination.

â€œI tell you what, M. Franz,â€ cried Albert, â€œyou deserve to be called
out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were
pleased to bestow on me just now.â€

â€œAnd I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your
scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.â€

â€œWell, then, hearken to me.â€

â€œI listen.â€

â€œYou agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the
question?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œNeither can we procure horses?â€

â€œTrue; we have offered any sum, but have failed.â€

â€œWell, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might be
had.â€

â€œVery possibly.â€

â€œAnd a pair of oxen?â€

â€œAs easily found as the cart.â€

â€œThen you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our
business can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if
you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a
striking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by LÃ©opold
Robert. It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join
us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group
would then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite
beautiful enough to represent a Madonna.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Franz, â€œthis time, M. Albert, I am bound to give you
credit for having hit upon a most capital idea.â€

â€œAnd quite a national one, too,â€ replied Albert with gratified pride.
â€œA mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye Romans!
you thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your
processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are
to be had in your beggarly city. But you donâ€™t know us; when we canâ€™t
have one thing we invent another.â€

â€œAnd have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?â€

â€œOnly to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then
explained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing
would be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry
for; when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me
there would not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so
you see we must do without this little superfluity.â€

â€œAnd where is he now?â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œOur host.â€

â€œGone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.â€

â€œThen he will be able to give us an answer tonight.â€

â€œOh, I expect him every minute.â€

At this instant the door opened, and the head of Signor Pastrini
appeared. â€œ_Permesso_?â€ inquired he.

â€œCertainlyâ€”certainly,â€ cried Franz. â€œCome in, my host.â€

â€œNow, then,â€ asked Albert eagerly, â€œhave you found the desired cart and
oxen?â€

â€œBetter than that!â€ replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a man
perfectly well satisfied with himself.

â€œTake care, my worthy host,â€ said Albert, â€œ_better_ is a sure enemy to
_well_.â€

â€œLet your excellencies only leave the matter to me,â€ returned Signor
Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.

â€œBut what _have_ you done?â€ asked Franz. â€œSpeak out, thereâ€™s a worthy
fellow.â€

â€œYour excellencies are aware,â€ responded the landlord, swelling with
importance, â€œthat the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor
with yourselves!â€

â€œI should think we did know it,â€ exclaimed Albert, â€œsince it is owing
to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like
two poor students in the back streets of Paris.â€

â€œWhen, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which
you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two
places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.â€ The friends looked at
each other with unutterable surprise.

â€œBut do you think,â€ asked Albert, â€œthat we ought to accept such offers
from a perfect stranger?â€

â€œWhat sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?â€ asked Franz of his
host.

â€œA very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot
exactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich
as a gold mine.â€

â€œIt seems to me,â€ said Franz, speaking in an undertone to Albert, â€œthat
if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would
have conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted
it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He would have
writtenâ€”orâ€”â€”â€

At this instant someone knocked at the door.

â€œCome in,â€ said Franz.

A servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness,
appeared at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlordâ€™s
hands, who forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said:

â€œPlease to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte
Albert de Morcerf and M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,â€
continued the servant, â€œbegs these gentlemenâ€™s permission to wait upon
them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what
time they will please to receive him.â€

â€œFaith, Franz,â€ whispered Albert, â€œthere is not much to find fault with
here.â€

â€œTell the count,â€ replied Franz, â€œthat we will do ourselves the
pleasure of calling on him.â€

The servant bowed and retired.

â€œThat is what I call an elegant mode of attack,â€ said Albert, â€œYou were
quite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count of Monte
Cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of
the world.â€

â€œThen you accept his offer?â€ said the host.

â€œOf course we do,â€ replied Albert. â€œStill, I must own I am sorry to be
obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapersâ€”it would have
produced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo
Rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, I
donâ€™t know but what I should have held on by my original plan. What say
you, Franz?â€

â€œOh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided
me.â€

The truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli
had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding
evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown
and the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken
to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled-up
individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as the person
he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to
establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting
him with perfect facility and freedom.

Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings
he had already had with his mysterious tormentor, and in waking
speculations as to what the morrow would produce. The next day must
clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend,
the Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring of Gyges, and by its
power was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain he
could not escape this time.

Eight oâ€™clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the
same motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. The first act
of Franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his
accustomed obsequiousness.

â€œPray, Signor Pastrini,â€ asked Franz, â€œis not some execution appointed
to take place today?â€

â€œYes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may
procure a window to view it from, you are much too late.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ answered Franz, â€œI had no such intention; and even if I had
felt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so from Monte
Pincio; could I not?â€

â€œAh!â€ exclaimed mine host, â€œI did not think it likely your excellency
would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected
on that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively belonging to
themselves.â€

â€œVery possibly I may not go,â€ answered Franz; â€œbut in case I feel
disposed, give me some particulars of todayâ€™s executions.â€

â€œWhat particulars would your excellency like to hear?â€

â€œWhy, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and
description of the death they are to die.â€

â€œThat happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago they
brought me the _tavolettas_.â€

â€œWhat are they?â€

â€œSort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening
before an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the names
of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The
reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and
faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate
culprits, and, above all, beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere
repentance.â€

â€œAnd these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to
those of the faithful, are they?â€ asked Franz somewhat incredulously.

â€œOh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybodyâ€™s affairs
but my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an agreement
with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he
would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should
like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information
concerning the time and place etc.â€

â€œUpon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, Signor
Pastrini,â€ cried Franz.

â€œWhy, your excellency,â€ returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing
his hands with infinite complacency, â€œI think I may take upon myself to
say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble
visitors to this poor hotel.â€

â€œI see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely
upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your
guests wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these
_tavolettas_.â€

â€œNothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencyâ€™s wish,â€
said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; â€œI have caused one
to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.â€

Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read
as follows:

â€œâ€˜The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd, being the
first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza del
Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named
Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former
found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named
Don CÃ©sar Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the
latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary
bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will be
_mazzolato_, the second culprit _decapitato_.

â€œâ€˜The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these
unfortunate men, that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of
their guilt, and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for
their crimes.â€™â€

This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins
of the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,â€”the names of the
condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed
with his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the
Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the
man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as â€œSinbad the
Sailor,â€ but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic
expedition in Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.

Time was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken
Albert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his
friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated
delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave
his pillow long before his usual hour.

â€œNow, my excellent Signor Pastrini,â€ said Franz, addressing his
landlord, â€œsince we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once
to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?â€

â€œMost assuredly,â€ replied he. â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo is always an
early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.â€

â€œThen you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our
respects to him directly?â€

20155m



â€œOh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you find I
have led you into an error.â€

â€œWell, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?â€

â€œPerfectly.â€

â€œLet us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.â€

â€œYes, let us do so.â€

The landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all
that separated them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell,
and, upon the door being opened by a servant, said:

â€œ_I signori Francesi_.â€

The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed
through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not
expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into
an elegantly fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered
the floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and
sofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as
desired repose or refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters
were ranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies
of war, while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before
the different doors of the room.

â€œIf your excellencies will please to be seated,â€ said the man, â€œI will
let the count know that you are here.â€

And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried
_portiÃ¨res_. As the door opened, the sound of a _guzla_ reached the
ears of the young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid
closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter.
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous
furnishings of the apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a
second view than it had done at their first rapid survey.

â€œWell,â€ said Franz to his friend, â€œwhat think you of all this?â€

â€œWhy, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and
attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has
speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling
_incog_.â€

â€œHush, hush!â€ replied Franz; â€œwe shall ascertain who and what he isâ€”he
comes!â€

As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and
almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the
owner of all these riches stood before the two young men. Albert
instantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound
on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he
recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the
occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary
host of Monte Cristo.

20157m




 Chapter 35. La Mazzolata

Gentlemen,â€ said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, â€œI pray you
excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to
disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides,
you sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at
your disposal.â€

â€œFranz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,â€ returned
Albert; â€œyou extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the
point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly
invitation reached us.â€

â€œIndeed,â€ returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.
â€œIt was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did not sooner
assist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of your
embarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am, I
seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As
soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized
the opportunity of offering my services.â€

The two young men bowed. Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he
had come to no determination, and as nothing in the countâ€™s manner
manifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know
whether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more
proof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the
previous evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the
man he had seen at the Colosseum. He resolved, therefore, to let things
take their course without making any direct overture to the count.
Moreover, he had this advantage, he was master of the countâ€™s secret,
while the count had no hold on Franz, who had nothing to conceal.
However, he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might
possibly clear up his doubts.

â€œCount,â€ said he, â€œyou have offered us places in your carriage, and at
your windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where we can obtain
a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?â€

â€œAh,â€ said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, â€œis
there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?â€

â€œYes,â€ returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point
he wished.

â€œStay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps I
can render you this slight service also.â€

He extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.

â€œDid you ever occupy yourself,â€ said he to Franz, â€œwith the employment
of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants? I
have. When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo;
thrice, for my steward,â€”thus I do not waste a minute or a word. Here he
is.â€

A man of about forty-five or fifty entered, exactly resembling the
smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern; but he did not
appear to recognize him. It was evident he had his orders.

â€œMonsieur Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œyou have procured me windows
looking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.â€

â€œYes, excellency,â€ returned the steward; â€œbut it was very late.â€

â€œDid I not tell you I wished for one?â€ replied the count, frowning.

â€œAnd your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I
was obliged to pay a hundredâ€”â€”â€

â€œThat will doâ€”that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen
all such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is
sufficient. Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the
stairs to conduct us to it.â€

The steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.

â€œAh!â€ continued the count, â€œbe good enough to ask Pastrini if he has
received the _tavoletta_, and if he can send us an account of the
execution.â€

â€œThere is no need to do that,â€ said Franz, taking out his tablets; â€œfor
I saw the account, and copied it down.â€

â€œVery well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer. Let us
know when breakfast is ready. These gentlemen,â€ added he, turning to
the two friends, â€œwill, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?â€

â€œBut, my dear count,â€ said Albert, â€œwe shall abuse your kindness.â€

â€œNot at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You
will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.
Bertuccio, lay covers for three.â€

He then took Franzâ€™s tablets out of his hand. â€œâ€˜We announce,â€™ he read,
in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper, â€˜that
today, the 23rd of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo, guilty of
murder on the person of the respected and venerated Don CÃ©sar Torlini,
canon of the church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca
Priori, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa,
and the men of his band.â€™

â€œHum! â€˜The first will be _mazzolato_, the second _decapitato_.â€™ Yes,â€
continued the count, â€œit was at first arranged in this way; but I think
since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the
ceremony.â€

â€œReally?â€ said Franz.

â€œYes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosiâ€™s, and there
mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.â€

â€œFor Andrea Rondolo?â€ asked Franz.

â€œNo,â€ replied the count, carelessly; â€œfor the other (he glanced at the
tablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called Rocca Priori.
You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the _mazzolata_
still remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the
first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is
very simple. The _mandaÃ¯a_6 never fails, never trembles, never strikes
thirty times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the Count of
Chalais, and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended
the sufferer. Ah,â€ added the count, in a contemptuous tone, â€œdo not
tell me of European punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the
old age, of cruelty.â€

â€œReally, count,â€ replied Franz, â€œone would think that you had studied
the different tortures of all the nations of the world.â€

â€œThere are, at least, few that I have not seen,â€ said the count coldly.

â€œAnd you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?â€

â€œMy first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third
curiosity.â€

â€œCuriosityâ€”that is a terrible word.â€

â€œWhy so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then,
curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can
part; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments,
and even the different customs of their countries, different persons
bear the transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation?
As for myself, I can assure you of one thing,â€”the more men you see die,
the easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be
a torture, but it is not an expiation.â€

â€œI do not quite understand you,â€ replied Franz; â€œpray explain your
meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.â€

â€œListen,â€ said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the
blood would to the face of any other. â€œIf a man had by unheard-of and
excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your
betrothed,â€”a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound
that never closes, in your breast,â€”do you think the reparation that
society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the
guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of
the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral
sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?â€

â€œYes, I know,â€ said Franz, â€œthat human justice is insufficient to
console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but
you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.â€

â€œI will put another case to you,â€ continued the count; â€œthat where
society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death. But
are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer
without society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him
even the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?
Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers
of the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are
inadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do
not these crimes exist?â€

â€œYes,â€ answered Franz; â€œand it is to punish them that duelling is
tolerated.â€

â€œAh, duelling,â€ cried the count; â€œa pleasant manner, upon my soul, of
arriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man has carried off
your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your
daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to
expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to
everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you
think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass
a sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your
brain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is
often he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all
crime in the eyes of the world. No, no,â€ continued the count, â€œhad I to
avenge myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.â€

â€œThen you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?â€ asked
Albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.

â€œOh, yes,â€ replied the count; â€œunderstand me, I would fight a duel for
a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my
skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have
gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man. Oh, I
would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound,
eternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible; an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,â€”our masters
in everything,â€”those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a
life of dreams and a paradise of realities.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Franz to the count, â€œwith this theory, which renders you at
once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to
adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power
of the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours
out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.â€

â€œYes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful;
besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of
which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic French
Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken
on the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?
On my word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserable
Peppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then
of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is
worth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation
for the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I recollect, you
asked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit
down to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast
is ready.â€

As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment,
saying:

â€œ_Al suo commodo!_â€

The two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.

During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz
looked repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which
he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer;
but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little
attention to him, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo
with regard to duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which
Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his
companion did not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate
like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to
partake of Italian cookeryâ€”that is, the worst in the world.

As for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the
duties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their
departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food. This
brought back to Franz, in spite of himself, the recollection of the
terror with which the count had inspired the Countess Gâ€”â€”, and her firm
conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire.

At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.

â€œWell,â€ said the count, â€œwhat are you doing?â€

â€œYou must excuse us, count,â€ returned Franz, â€œbut we have still much to
do.â€

â€œWhat may that be?â€

â€œWe have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.â€

â€œDo not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room
in the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose
brought to us, and you can dress there.â€

â€œAfter the execution?â€ cried Franz.

â€œBefore or after, whichever you please.â€

â€œOpposite the scaffold?â€

â€œThe scaffold forms part of the _fÃªte_.â€

â€œCount, I have reflected on the matter,â€ said Franz, â€œI thank you for
your courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in
your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you
at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.â€

â€œBut I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,â€ returned the
count.

â€œYou will describe it to me,â€ replied Franz, â€œand the recital from your
lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it. I
have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never
been able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?â€

â€œI,â€ replied the viscount,â€”â€œI saw Castaing executed, but I think I was
rather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same
morning, and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.â€

â€œBesides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at
Paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it
is to see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are
asked, â€˜How do they execute at Rome?â€™ and you reply, â€˜I do not know!â€™
And, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who
killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like
his own son. _Diable!_ when a churchman is killed, it should be with a
different weapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a
father. If you went to Spain, would you not see the bull-fights? Well,
suppose it is a bull-fight you are going to see? Recollect the ancient
Romans of the Circus, and the sports where they killed three hundred
lions and a hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand applauding
spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming
Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign
that said, â€˜Come, despatch the dying.â€™â€

â€œShall you go, then, Albert?â€ asked Franz.

â€œ_Ma foi_, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the countâ€™s eloquence
decides me.â€

â€œLet us go, then,â€ said Franz, â€œsince you wish it; but on our way to
the Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is this
possible, count?â€

â€œOn foot, yes, in a carriage, no.â€

â€œI will go on foot, then.â€

â€œIs it important that you should go that way?â€

â€œYes, there is something I wish to see.â€

â€œWell, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait for
us on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be
glad to pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have
given have been executed.â€

â€œExcellency,â€ said a servant, opening the door, â€œa man in the dress of
a penitent wishes to speak to you.â€

â€œAh! yes,â€ returned the count, â€œI know who he is, gentlemen; will you
return to the salon? you will find good cigars on the centre table. I
will be with you directly.â€

The young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again
apologizing, left by another door. Albert, who was a great smoker, and
who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars
of the CafÃ© de Paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at
perceiving some veritable _puros_.

â€œWell,â€ asked Franz, â€œwhat think you of the Count of Monte Cristo?â€

â€œWhat do I think?â€ said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question
from his companion; â€œI think he is a delightful fellow, who does the
honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,
like Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,â€ added he, sending a
volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, â€œthat he has excellent cigars.â€

Such was Albertâ€™s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that
Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection,
he made no attempt to change it.

â€œBut,â€ said he, â€œdid you observe one very singular thing?â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œHow attentively he looked at you.â€

â€œAt me?â€

â€œYes.â€

Albert reflected. â€œAh,â€ replied he, sighing, â€œthat is not very
surprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and my
clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a
provincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and
tell him I am nothing of the kind.â€

Franz smiled; an instant after the count entered.

â€œI am now quite at your service, gentlemen,â€ said he. â€œThe carriage is
going one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go another; and, if
you please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars, M. de
Morcerf.â€

â€œWith all my heart,â€ returned Albert; â€œItalian cigars are horrible.
When you come to Paris, I will return all this.â€

â€œI will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow me,
I will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is
half-past twelveâ€”let us set off.â€

All three descended; the coachman received his masterâ€™s orders, and
drove down the Via del Babuino. While the three gentlemen walked along
the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina, which led directly between
the Fiano and Rospoli palaces, Franzâ€™s attention was directed towards
the windows of that last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal
agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant.

â€œWhich are your windows?â€ asked he of the count, with as much
indifference as he could assume.

â€œThe three last,â€ returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected,
for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.

Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows. The side windows were
hung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red
cross. The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin,
and there could now be no doubt that he was the count.

The three windows were still untenanted. Preparations were making on
every side; chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were
hung with flags. The masks could not appear; the carriages could not
move about; but the masks were visible behind the windows, the
carriages, and the doors.

Franz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they
approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and
above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,
surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in
front of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del
Babuino, del Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the
scaffold, between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaÃ¯a_.

At the corner of the street they met the countâ€™s steward, who was
awaiting his master. The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the
count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the
second floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino
and the Monte Pincio. It consisted, as we have said, of a small
dressing-room, opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of
communication was shut, the inmates were quite alone. On chairs were
laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin.

20167m



â€œAs you left the choice of your costumes to me,â€ said the count to the
two friends, â€œI have had these brought, as they will be the most worn
this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the _confetti_
(sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.â€

Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did
not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was
wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented,
and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.

It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,â€”we say
guillotine, because the Roman _mandaÃ¯a_ is formed on almost the same
model as the French instrument.7 The knife, which is shaped like a
crescent, that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and
that is all the difference.

Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were
eating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal. Their repast
consisted apparently of bread and sausages. One of them lifted the
plank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his
companion. These two men were the executionerâ€™s assistants.

At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.

The prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove
to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night,
each accompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating,
before which were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals. A
double line of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the
church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving
a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly
a hundred feet.

All the rest of the square was paved with heads. Many women held their
infants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.
The Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the
balconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and
the Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti-colored
sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall
held its living statue. What the count said was trueâ€”the most curious
spectacle in life is that of death.

And yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the
occasion, laughter and jests arose from the crowd. It was evident that
the execution was, in the eyes of the people, only the commencement of
the Carnival.

Suddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church
opened. A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes
of gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands
lighted tapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head.

20169m



Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was
naked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which
hung a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a
heavy iron sledge-hammer.

This man was the executioner.

He had, moreover, sandals bound on his feet by cords.

Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die,
first Peppino and then Andrea. Each was accompanied by two priests.
Neither had his eyes bandaged.

Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him.
Andrea was supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time,
kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them.

At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him. He looked at
Albertâ€”he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his
cigar, although he had not half smoked it. The count alone seemed
unmovedâ€”nay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale
cheeks. His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its
prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and
sharp like those of a jackal. And yet his features wore an expression
of smiling tenderness, such as Franz had never before witnessed in
them; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.

However, the two culprits advanced, and as they approached their faces
became visible. Peppino was a handsome young man of four or
five-and-twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect, and
seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear.
Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did
not indicate age; he might be thirty. In prison he had suffered his
beard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath
him, and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.

â€œI thought,â€ said Franz to the count, â€œthat you told me there would be
but one execution.â€

â€œI told you true,â€ replied he coldly.

â€œAnd yet here are two culprits.â€

â€œYes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many
years to live.â€

â€œIf the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.â€

â€œAnd see, here it is,â€ said the count. At the moment when Peppino
reached the foot of the _mandaÃ¯a_, a priest arrived in some haste,
forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the
brotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had
noticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his
hand, â€œHeaven be praised, and his Holiness also,â€ said he in a loud
voice; â€œhere is a pardon for one of the prisoners!â€

â€œA pardon!â€ cried the people with one voice; â€œa pardon!â€

At this cry Andrea raised his head.

â€œPardon for whom?â€ cried he.

Peppino remained breathless.

â€œA pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,â€ said the principal friar.
And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who
read and returned it to him.

â€œFor Peppino!â€ cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which
he had been plunged. â€œWhy for him and not for me? We ought to die
together. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right to
put me to death alone. I will not die aloneâ€”I will not!â€

And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast,
and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The
executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the
scaffold and seized him.

â€œWhat is going on?â€ asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was
in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.

â€œDo you not see?â€ returned the count, â€œthat this human creature who is
about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with
him? and, were he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his
teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be
deprived of. Oh, man, manâ€”race of crocodiles,â€ cried the count,
extending his clenched hands towards the crowd, â€œhow well do I
recognize you there, and that at all times you are worthy of
yourselves!â€

Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the
ground, and he kept exclaiming, â€œHe ought to die!â€”he shall die!â€”I will
not die alone!â€

â€œLook, look,â€ cried the count, seizing the young menâ€™s hands; â€œlook,
for on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who had resigned himself to
his fate, who was going to the scaffold to dieâ€”like a coward, it is
true, but he was about to die without resistance. Do you know what gave
him strength? do you know what consoled him? It was, that another
partook of his punishmentâ€”that another partook of his anguishâ€”that
another was to die before him! Lead two sheep to the butcherâ€™s, two
oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his
companion will not die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will
bellow with joy. But manâ€”man, whom God created in his own imageâ€”man,
upon whom God has laid his first, his sole commandment, to love his
neighborâ€”man, to whom God has given a voice to express his
thoughtsâ€”what is his first cry when he hears his fellow-man is saved? A
blasphemy. Honor to man, this masterpiece of nature, this king of the
creation!â€

And the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must
have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.

However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness.
The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all
took part against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, â€œPut him to
death! put him to death!â€

Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before
the window.

â€œWhat are you doing?â€ said he. â€œDo you pity him? If you heard the cry
of â€˜Mad dog!â€™ you would take your gunâ€”you would unhesitatingly shoot
the poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten
by another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one
of his race, has yet murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to
kill anyone, because his hands are bound, wishes to see his companion
in captivity perish. No, noâ€”look, look!â€

20172m



The recommendation was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible
spectacle.

The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and there, in
spite of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced him to his
knees. During this time the executioner had raised his mace, and signed
to them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise, but, ere he
had time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy sound was
heard, and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over
on his back.

The executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one stroke
opened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently on it
with his feet. At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound.

This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half
fainting, into a seat.

Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the
window-curtains.

The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel!



 Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome

When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of
water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and
the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced
mechanically towards the piazzaâ€”the scene was wholly changed; scaffold,
executioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained,
full of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only
sounds on the popeâ€™s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was
ringing a joyous peal.

â€œWell,â€ asked he of the count, â€œwhat has, then, happened?â€

â€œNothing,â€ replied the count; â€œonly, as you see, the Carnival has
commenced. Make haste and dress yourself.â€

â€œIn fact,â€ said Franz, â€œthis horrible scene has passed away like a
dream.â€

â€œIt is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.â€

â€œYes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?â€

â€œThat is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have
awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?â€

â€œBut Peppinoâ€”what has become of him?â€

â€œPeppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in
proportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general
attention was directed towards his companion. He profited by this
distraction to slip away among the crowd, without even thanking the
worthy priests who accompanied him. Decidedly man is an ungrateful and
egotistical animal. But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you the
example.â€

Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and
varnished boots.

â€œWell, Albert,â€ said Franz, â€œdo you feel much inclined to join the
revels? Come, answer frankly.â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, no,â€ returned Albert. â€œBut I am really glad to have seen
such a sight; and I understand what the count saidâ€”that when you have
once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the only one
that causes you any emotion.â€

20175m



â€œWithout reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study
character,â€ said the count; â€œon the steps of the scaffold death tears
off the mask that has been worn through life, and the real visage is
disclosed. It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome, the
hideous scoundrel! Come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress
yourselves.â€

Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companionsâ€™
example. He assumed his costume, and fastened on the mask that scarcely
equalled the pallor of his own face. Their toilet finished, they
descended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled with
sweetmeats and bouquets. They fell into the line of carriages.

It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken
place. Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza
del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry. A
crowd of masks flowed in from all sides, emerging from the doors,
descending from the windows. From every street and every corner drove
carriages filled with clowns, harlequins, dominoes, mummers,
pantomimists, Transteverins, knights, and peasants, screaming,
fighting, gesticulating, throwing eggs filled with flour, confetti,
nosegays, attacking, with their sarcasms and their missiles, friends
and foes, companions and strangers, indiscriminately, and no one took
offence, or did anything but laugh.

Franz and Albert were like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow,
have recourse to wine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated,
feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present. They saw, or
rather continued to see, the image of what they had witnessed; but
little by little the general vertigo seized them, and they felt
themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion.

A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which,
while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his
neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred
pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks
around him were engaged. He rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of
confetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them
with all the force and skill he was master of.

20177m



The strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen
half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young menâ€™s minds,
so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they
now beheld.

As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant shown any
appearance of having been moved. Imagine the large and splendid Corso,
bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their
balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. At these
balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsâ€”Romans, Italians,
strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,
wealth, and genius. Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the
scene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and
shower down confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems
darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers. In the streets
the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesâ€”gigantic
cabbages walk gravely about, buffaloesâ€™ heads bellow from menâ€™s
shoulders, dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a
mask is lifted, and, as in Callotâ€™s Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely
face is exhibited, which we would fain follow, but from which we are
separated by troops of fiends. This will give a faint idea of the
Carnival at Rome.

At the second turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested
permission to withdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal. Franz
looked upâ€”they were opposite the Rospoli Palace. At the centre window,
the one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino,
beneath which Franzâ€™s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek
of the Argentina.

â€œGentlemen,â€ said the count, springing out, â€œwhen you are tired of
being actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene, you know you
have places at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my coachman, my
carriage, and my servants.â€

We have forgotten to mention, that the countâ€™s coachman was attired in
a bear-skin, exactly resembling Odryâ€™s in _The Bear and the Pasha_; and
the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring
masks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.

Franz thanked the count for his attention. As for Albert, he was busily
occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that
was passing near him. Unfortunately for him, the line of carriages
moved on again, and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo, the other
ascended towards the Palazzo di Venezia.

â€œAh, my dear fellow,â€ said he to Franz; â€œyou did not see?â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œThere,â€”that calash filled with Roman peasants.â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œWell, I am convinced they are all charming women.â€

â€œHow unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,â€ said Franz; â€œhere was
an opportunity of making up for past disappointments.â€

â€œOh,â€ replied he, half laughing, half serious; â€œI hope the Carnival
will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other.â€

But, in spite of Albertâ€™s hope, the day passed unmarked by any
incident, excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of
Roman peasants. At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely,
Albertâ€™s mask fell off. He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the
bouquets into the carriage. Doubtless one of the charming females
Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by
his gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she
threw a bunch of violets. Albert seized it, and as Franz had no reason
to suppose it was meant for him, he suffered Albert to retain it.
Albert placed it in his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly
on.

â€œWell,â€ said Franz to him; â€œthere is the beginning of an adventure.â€

â€œLaugh if you pleaseâ€”I really think so. So I will not abandon this
bouquet.â€

â€œ_Pardieu_,â€ returned Franz, laughing, â€œin token of your ingratitude.â€

The jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when Albert and
Franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_, the one who
had thrown the violets to Albert, clapped her hands when she beheld
them in his button-hole.

â€œBravo, bravo,â€ said Franz; â€œthings go wonderfully. Shall I leave you?
Perhaps you would prefer being alone?â€

â€œNo,â€ replied he; â€œI will not be caught like a fool at a first
disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock, as they say at the
opera-balls. If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further,
we shall find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will
give me some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.â€

â€œOn my word,â€ said Franz, â€œyou are as wise as Nestor and prudent as
Ulysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if
she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.â€

Albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry
the intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more
turns, they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of
the neighboring streets. Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace; but
the count and the blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows,
hung with yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the
count had invited.

At this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the
mascherata sounded the retreat. The file on the Corso broke the line,
and in a second all the carriages had disappeared. Franz and Albert
were opposite the Via delle Muratte; the coachman, without saying a
word, drove up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli
Palace and stopped at the door of the hotel. Signor Pastrini came to
the door to receive his guests.

Franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that
he had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini reassured him by
saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for
himself, and that it had gone at four oâ€™clock to fetch him from the
Rospoli Palace.

The count had, moreover, charged him to offer the two friends the key
of his box at the Argentina. Franz questioned Albert as to his
intentions; but Albert had great projects to put into execution before
going to the theatre; and instead of making any answer, he inquired if
Signor Pastrini could procure him a tailor.

â€œA tailor,â€ said the host; â€œand for what?â€

â€œTo make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes,â€
returned Albert.

The host shook his head.

â€œTo make you two costumes between now and tomorrow? I ask your
excellenciesâ€™ pardon, but this is quite a French demand; for the next
week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six
buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each
button.â€

â€œThen I must give up the idea?â€

â€œNo; we have them ready-made. Leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you
awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be
satisfied.â€

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ said Franz, â€œleave all to our host; he has already
proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards
go and see _lâ€™Italienne Ã  Alger!_

â€œAgreed,â€ returned Albert; â€œbut remember, Signor Pastrini, that both my
friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the
costumes we have asked for.â€

The host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their
wishes should be attended to; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to
their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their
costumes. Albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the
bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.

The two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from
remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristoâ€™s table and
that of Signor Pastrini. Truth compelled Franz, in spite of the dislike
he seemed to have taken to the count, to confess that the advantage was
not on Pastriniâ€™s side. During dessert, the servant inquired at what
time they wished for the carriage. Albert and Franz looked at each
other, fearing really to abuse the countâ€™s kindness. The servant
understood them.

â€œHis excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had,â€ he said, â€œgiven
positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordshipsâ€™
orders all day, and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of
indiscretion.â€

They resolved to profit by the countâ€™s courtesy, and ordered the horses
to be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which
they had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats
they had sustained.

20181m



This precaution taken, they went to the theatre, and installed
themselves in the countâ€™s box. During the first act, the Countess Gâ€”â€”
entered. Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the
previous evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place
of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an
opinion to Franz. Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them,
that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and,
availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the
Italian theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two
friends went to pay their respects to the countess. Scarcely had they
entered, when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor.
Albert, in his turn, sat behind.

â€œWell,â€ said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, â€œit seems you
have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new
Lord Ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.â€

â€œWithout being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,â€ returned
Franz, â€œI cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.â€

â€œAll day?â€

â€œYes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage all
day, and now we have taken possession of his box.â€

â€œYou know him, then?â€

â€œYes, and no.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œIt is a long story.â€

â€œTell it to me.â€

â€œIt would frighten you too much.â€

â€œSo much the more reason.â€

â€œAt least wait until the story has a conclusion.â€

â€œVery well; I prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his
acquaintance? Did anyone introduce you to him?â€

â€œNo; it was he who introduced himself to us.â€

â€œWhen?â€

â€œLast night, after we left you.â€

â€œThrough what medium?â€

â€œThe very prosaic one of our landlord.â€

â€œHe is staying, then, at the HÃ´tel de Londres with you?â€

â€œNot only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.â€

â€œWhat is his name; for, of course, you know?â€

â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo.â€

â€œThat is not a family name?â€

â€œNo, it is the name of the island he has purchased.â€

â€œAnd he is a count?â€

â€œA Tuscan count.â€

â€œWell, we must put up with that,â€ said the countess, who was herself
from one of the oldest Venetian families. â€œWhat sort of a man is he?â€

â€œAsk the Vicomte de Morcerf.â€

â€œYou hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,â€ said the countess.

â€œWe should be very hard to please, madam,â€ returned Albert, â€œdid we not
think him delightful. A friend of ten yearsâ€™ standing could not have
done more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.â€

â€œCome,â€ observed the countess, smiling, â€œI see my vampire is only some
millionaire, who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid
being confounded with M. de Rothschild; and you have seen her?â€

â€œHer?â€

20183m



â€œThe beautiful Greek of yesterday.â€

â€œNo; we heard, I think, the sound of her _guzla_, but she remained
perfectly invisible.â€

â€œWhen you say invisible,â€ interrupted Albert, â€œit is only to keep up
the mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with
the white curtains?â€

â€œWhere was this window with white hangings?â€ asked the countess.

â€œAt the Rospoli Palace.â€

â€œThe count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?â€

â€œYes. Did you pass through the Corso?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with
white damask with a red cross? Those were the countâ€™s windows.â€

â€œWhy, he must be a nabob. Do you know what those three windows were
worth?â€

â€œTwo or three hundred Roman crowns?â€

â€œTwo or three thousand.â€

â€œThe deuce!â€

â€œDoes his island produce him such a revenue?â€

â€œIt does not bring him a bajocco.â€

â€œThen why did he purchase it?â€

â€œFor a whim.â€

â€œHe is an original, then?â€

â€œIn reality,â€ observed Albert, â€œhe seemed to me somewhat eccentric;
were he at Paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, I should say he was
a poor devil literally mad. This morning he made two or three exits
worthy of Didier or Anthony.â€

At this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz
gave up his seat to him. This circumstance had, moreover, the effect of
changing the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned
to their hotel.

Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the
morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. The
next morning, at nine oâ€™clock, he entered Franzâ€™s room, followed by a
tailor, who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm; they
selected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of
their hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the
long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders
decorate themselves on fÃªte days.

Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressâ€”a jacket and
breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with
buckles, and a silk waistcoat. This picturesque attire set him off to
great advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and
when his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his shoulder
a stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume has much
to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations. The
Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but
are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the
chin, and their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine
with a red seal? Franz complimented Albert, who looked at himself in
the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction. They were thus
engaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered.

20185m



â€œGentlemen,â€ said he, â€œalthough a companion is agreeable, perfect
freedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to say that today,
and for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at
your disposal. The host will tell you I have three or four more, so
that you will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of it, I pray
you, for your pleasure or your business.â€

The young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for
refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte
Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all
subjects with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said,
perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. A
glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was
a connoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he
was no stranger to the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with
chemistry. The two friends did not venture to return the count the
breakfast he had given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him
in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor
Pastrini. They told him so frankly, and he received their excuses with
the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmed
with the countâ€™s manners, and he was only prevented from recognizing
him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge.

The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above
all, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the
preceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing
with them. At half-past one they descended, the coachman and footman
had put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a more
ridiculous appearance than ever, and which gained them the applause of
Franz and Albert. Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his
button-hole. At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the
Corso by the Via Vittoria.

At the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage
filled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his
friend, the peasants had changed their costume also; and whether it was
the result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them
both, while he had donned their costume, they had assumed his.

Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the
faded one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it
to his lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair
lady who had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as
gay as the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the
count appeared for an instant at his window, but when they again passed
he had disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation
between Albert and the fair peasant continued all day.

In the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy,
informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his
holiness the next day. At each previous visit he had made to Rome, he
had solicited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by a
religious feeling as by gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital
of the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet
of one of St. Peterâ€™s successors who has set the rare example of all
the virtues. He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his
condescension and touching kindness, one cannot incline oneâ€™s self
without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.

On his return from the Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he
brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad
gayety of the maskers would have been profanation.

At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed. The harlequin had
reassumed her peasantâ€™s costume, and as she passed she raised her mask.
She was charming. Franz congratulated Albert, who received his
congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited.
He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs, that his fair
_incognita_ belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his mind to
write to her the next day.

Franz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed to have
something to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it. He
insisted upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any
sacrifice the other wished.

Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and
then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him
to occupy the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franzâ€™s
absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask.
Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of
an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and
so flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect
indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened;
and as, during three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a
similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was
by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore
promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with
witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli Palace.

The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous
bouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous
epistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the
bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a
charming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin.

The evening was no longer joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but
that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated
his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should
pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal. Albert was
not deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly
shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.

â€œWell,â€ said he, â€œwas I mistaken?â€

â€œShe has answered you!â€ cried Franz.

â€œRead.â€

This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe. Franz took
the letter, and read:

â€œTuesday evening, at seven oâ€™clock, descend from your carriage opposite
the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your
torch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of San
Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the
shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be
recognized. Until then you will not see me. â€”Constancy and Discretion.â€

â€œWell,â€ asked he, when Franz had finished, â€œwhat do you think of that?â€

â€œI think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.â€

â€œI think so, also,â€ replied Albert; â€œand I very much fear you will go
alone to the Duke of Braccianoâ€™s ball.â€

Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the
celebrated Roman banker.

â€œTake care, Albert,â€ said Franz. â€œAll the nobility of Rome will be
present, and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of
society, she must go there.â€

â€œWhether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,â€ returned
Albert. â€œYou have read the letter?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in
Italy?â€ (This is the name of the lower class.)

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you can,
any blemish in the language or orthography.â€ The writing was, in
reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.

â€œYou are born to good fortune,â€ said Franz, as he returned the letter.

â€œLaugh as much as you will,â€ replied Albert, â€œI am in love.â€

â€œYou alarm me,â€ cried Franz. â€œI see that I shall not only go alone to
the Duke of Braccianoâ€™s, but also return to Florence alone.â€

â€œIf my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,â€ said Albert, â€œI
shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore Rome, and I
have always had a great taste for archÃ¦ology.â€

20189m



â€œCome, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of
seeing you a member of the Academy.â€

Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the
academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready. Albertâ€™s
love had not taken away his appetite. He hastened with Franz to seat
himself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner. After dinner,
the Count of Monte Cristo was announced. They had not seen him for two
days. Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to
Civita Vecchia. He had started the previous evening, and had only
returned an hour since. He was charming. Whether he kept a watch over
himself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords
that in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like
everybody else.

The man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franz
recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating
any previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however great
Franzâ€™s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of
being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with
kindness prevented him from mentioning it.

The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at
the Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence,
he brought them the key of his ownâ€”at least such was the apparent
motive of his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging
their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he
was going to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would
be lost if they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two
friends to accept it.

Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the countâ€™s pallor, which had
so forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain
from admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or
rather the principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic
hero! Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him
without imagining his stern head upon Manfredâ€™s shoulders, or beneath
Laraâ€™s helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the
constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem
to penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip
that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses
them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed.

The count was no longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it was
easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom
he associated at present. And, to complete his resemblance with the
fantastic heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the
power of fascination. Albert was constantly expatiating on their good
fortune in meeting such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the
count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always
acquires over a mind less domineering. He thought several times of the
project the count had of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that,
with his eccentric character, his characteristic face, and his colossal
fortune, he would produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish
to be at Paris when the count was there.

The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; that
is, not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing.
The Countess Gâ€”â€” wished to revive the subject of the count, but Franz
announced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of
Albertâ€™s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess of
the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days. As
similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credit
travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, but
congratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating, to
meet at the Duke of Braccianoâ€™s ball, to which all Rome was invited.

The heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of
her existence the morrow or the day after.

At length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the
Carnival. On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten oâ€™clock in the morning,
as Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through
want of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival
before, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and
excitement. From two oâ€™clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the
_fÃªte_, exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and
the pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horsesâ€™ feet and the carriage
wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.

The _fÃªtes_ are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of
this history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not
recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those
events so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his
harlequin costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his
shoulder almost to the ground. In order that there might be no
confusion, Franz wore his peasantâ€™s costume.

As the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the
pavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was
silent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up
of a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs,
oranges, and nosegays.

At three oâ€™clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the Piazza del
Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the din
and confusion) announced that the races were about to begin.

The races, like the _moccoli_, are one of the episodes peculiar to the
last days of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages
instantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these
evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous
rapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians
ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and
the clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen
abreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi_.
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley
of fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear.

Almost instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry,
seven or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand
spectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo
fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won.

Immediately, without any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing
on towards the Corso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a
while, which again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream
again continued its course between its two granite banks.

A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers
of _moccoletti_ entered on the scene. The _moccoli_, or _moccoletti_,
are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight,
and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival
two very serious problems to grapple with,â€”first, how to keep his own
_moccoletto_ alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the _moccoletti_
of others. The _moccoletto_ is like life: man has found but one means
of transmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered
a thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided
him. The _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who
can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_?â€”the
gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.
Everyone hastened to purchase _moccoletti_â€”Franz and Albert among the
rest.

The night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of
â€œ_Moccoletti_!â€ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors,
two or three stars began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At
the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from
the Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the
Piazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the _fÃªte_
of Jack-oâ€™-lanterns.

It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it. Suppose
that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild
dance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied by cries that
were never heard in any other part of the world. The _facchino_ follows
the prince, the Transteverin the citizen, everyone blowing,
extinguishing, relighting. Had old Ã†olus appeared at this moment, he
would have been proclaimed king of the _moccoli_, and Aquilo the
heir-presumptive to the throne.

This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours; the Corso was
light as day; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth
stories were visible.

Every five minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to
seven. The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang
out, bearing his _moccoletto_ in his hand. Two or three masks strove to
knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate
pugilist, sent them rolling in the street, one after the other, and
continued his course towards the church of San Giacomo.

The steps were crowded with masks, who strove to snatch each otherâ€™s
torches. Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him mount the
first step.

Instantly a mask, wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman,
snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance.
Franz was too far off to hear what they said; but, without doubt,
nothing hostile passed, for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the
peasant girl. He watched them pass through the crowd for some time, but
at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello.

Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival
sounded, and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished
as if by enchantment. It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind
had extinguished everyone.

Franz found himself in utter darkness. No sound was audible save that
of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was
visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows.

The Carnival was over.

 Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian

In his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so
sudden an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as
in this moment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of
some demon of the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a
chance, which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the
moon, which was on the wane, did not rise until eleven oâ€™clock, and the
streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest
obscurity.

The distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or
rather the countâ€™s, stopped before the HÃ´tel de Londres.

Dinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not
return so soon, Franz sat down without him. Signor Pastrini, who had
been accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of
his absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the
previous evening an invitation which he had accepted.

The sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_, the darkness which had
replaced the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil,
had left in Franzâ€™s mind a certain depression which was not free from
uneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in spite of the officious
attention of his host, who presented himself two or three times to
inquire if he wanted anything.

Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the
carriage, therefore, for eleven oâ€™clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to
inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel.

At eleven oâ€™clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and
went out, telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the
Duke of Braccianoâ€™s. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the
most delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the
Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus
their _fÃªtes_ have a European celebrity.

Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them,
and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts
of his travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the
moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_, and that he had
lost sight of him in the Via Macello.

â€œThen he has not returned?â€ said the duke.

â€œI waited for him until this hour,â€ replied Franz.

â€œAnd do you know whither he went?â€

â€œNo, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a
rendezvous.â€

â€œ_Diavolo!_â€ said the duke, â€œthis is a bad day, or rather a bad night,
to be out late; is it not, countess?â€

These words were addressed to the Countess Gâ€”â€”, who had just arrived,
and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the dukeâ€™s brother.

â€œI think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,â€ replied the
countess, â€œand those who are here will complain of but one thing, that
of its too rapid flight.â€

â€œI am not speaking,â€ said the duke with a smile, â€œof the persons who
are here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with
you, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely;
I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.â€

â€œAh,â€ asked the countess, â€œwho is out in the streets of Rome at this
hour, unless it be to go to a ball?â€

â€œOur friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his
unknown about seven oâ€™clock this evening,â€ said Franz, â€œand whom I have
not seen since.â€

â€œAnd donâ€™t you know where he is?â€

â€œNot at all.â€

â€œIs he armed?â€

â€œHe is in masquerade.â€

â€œYou should not have allowed him to go,â€ said the duke to Franz; â€œyou,
who know Rome better than he does.â€

â€œYou might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_,
who gained the prize in the race today,â€ replied Franz; â€œand then
moreover, what could happen to him?â€

â€œWho can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via
Macello.â€ Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that
the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his
own personal disquietude.

â€œI informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night
here, duke,â€ said Franz, â€œand desired them to come and inform me of his
return.â€

â€œAh,â€ replied the duke, â€œhere I think, is one of my servants who is
seeking you.â€

The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to
him.

â€œYour excellency,â€ he said, â€œthe master of the HÃ´tel de Londres has
sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from
the Viscount of Morcerf.â€

â€œA letter from the viscount!â€ exclaimed Franz.

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd who is the man?â€

â€œI do not know.â€

â€œWhy did he not bring it to me here?â€

â€œThe messenger did not say.â€

â€œAnd where is the messenger?â€

â€œHe went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.â€

â€œOh,â€ said the countess to Franz, â€œgo with all speedâ€”poor young man!
Perhaps some accident has happened to him.â€

â€œI will hasten,â€ replied Franz.

â€œShall we see you again to give us any information?â€ inquired the
countess.

â€œYes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to
what I may do myself.â€

â€œBe prudent, in any event,â€ said the countess.

â€œOh! pray be assured of that.â€

Franz took his hat and went away in haste. He had sent away his
carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two oâ€™clock; fortunately
the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side in the Corso, and on the
other in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is hardly ten minutesâ€™ walk
from the HÃ´tel de Londres.

As he came near the hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street.
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was
wrapped up in a large cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme
astonishment, the stranger first addressed him.

â€œWhat wants your excellency of me?â€ inquired the man, retreating a step
or two, as if to keep on his guard.

â€œAre not you the person who brought me a letter,â€ inquired Franz, â€œfrom
the Viscount of Morcerf?â€

â€œYour excellency lodges at Pastriniâ€™s hotel?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œYour excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?â€

â€œI am.â€

â€œYour excellencyâ€™s nameâ€”â€”â€

â€œIs the Baron Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

20199m



â€œThen it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.â€

â€œIs there any answer?â€ inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.

â€œYesâ€”your friend at least hopes so.â€

â€œCome upstairs with me, and I will give it to you.â€

â€œI prefer waiting here,â€ said the messenger, with a smile.

â€œAnd why?â€

â€œYour excellency will know when you have read the letter.â€

â€œShall I find you here, then?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

Franz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini.
â€œWell?â€ said the landlord.

â€œWellâ€”what?â€ responded Franz.

â€œYou have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?â€
he asked of Franz.

â€œYes, I have seen him,â€ he replied, â€œand he has handed this letter to
me. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.â€

The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light.
The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and
this had only made him the more anxious to read Albertâ€™s letter; and so
he went instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written
and signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend
what it contained. It was thus worded:

â€œMy dear Fellow,

â€œThe moment you have received this, have the kindness to take the
letter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find in the square
drawer of the _secrÃ©taire_; add your own to it, if it be not
sufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand
piastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have
this money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may
rely on me.

â€œYour friend,

â€œAlbert de Morcerf.

â€œP.S.â€”I now believe in Italian _banditti_.â€

Below these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in
Italian:

â€œ_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie
mani, alla sette il Conte Alberto avrÃ  cessato di vivere_.

â€œLuigi Vampa.â€

â€œ_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my
hands, by seven oâ€™clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live_.â€

This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood
the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the
street was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of
the famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time
refused to believe.

There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the _secrÃ©taire_, and
found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit.
There were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand
Albert had already expended three thousand.

As to Franz, he had no letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and
had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a
hundred louis, and of these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven
or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum
that Albert required. True, he might in such a case rely on the
kindness of Signor Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the
Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea
crossed his mind.

He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for
Signor Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself.

â€œMy dear sir,â€ he said, hastily, â€œdo you know if the count is within?â€

â€œYes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.â€

â€œIs he in bed?â€

â€œI should say no.â€

â€œThen ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind as
to give me an audience.â€

Signor Pastrini did as he was desired, and returning five minutes
after, he said:

â€œThe count awaits your excellency.â€

Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the
count. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which
was surrounded with divans. The count came towards him.

â€œWell, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?â€ said he; â€œhave
you come to sup with me? It would be very kind of you.â€

â€œNo; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.â€

â€œA serious matter,â€ said the count, looking at Franz with the
earnestness usual to him; â€œand what may it be?â€

â€œAre we alone?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave
him Albertâ€™s letter.

â€œRead that,â€ he said.

The count read it.

â€œWell, well!â€ said he.

â€œDid you see the postscript?â€

â€œI did, indeed.

â€œ_â€˜Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle
mie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avrÃ  cessato di vivere. _

â€œâ€˜Luigi Vampa.â€™â€

â€œWhat think you of that?â€ inquired Franz.

â€œHave you the money he demands?â€

â€œYes, all but eight hundred piastres.â€

The count went to his _secrÃ©taire_, opened it, and pulling out a drawer
filled with gold, said to Franz, â€œI hope you will not offend me by
applying to anyone but myself.â€

â€œYou see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,â€ replied
Franz.

â€œAnd I thank you; have what you will;â€ and he made a sign to Franz to
take what he pleased.

â€œIs it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?â€
asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.

â€œJudge for yourself,â€ replied he. â€œThe postscript is explicit.â€

â€œI think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could
find a way of simplifying the negotiation,â€ said Franz.

â€œHow so?â€ returned the count, with surprise.

â€œIf we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not
refuse you Albertâ€™s freedom.â€

â€œWhat influence can I possibly have over a bandit?â€

â€œHave you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?â€

â€œWhat is that?â€

â€œHave you not saved Peppinoâ€™s life?â€

â€œWell, well,â€ said the count, â€œwho told you that?â€

â€œNo matter; I know it.â€ The count knit his brows, and remained silent
an instant.

â€œAnd if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?â€

â€œIf my society would not be disagreeable.â€

â€œBe it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us
both good.â€

â€œShall I take any arms?â€

â€œFor what purpose?â€

â€œAny money?â€

â€œIt is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?â€

â€œIn the street.â€

â€œHe awaits the answer?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.â€

â€œIt is useless; he would not come up.â€

â€œTo your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at
entering mine.â€

The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the
street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in the mantle
quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.
â€œ_Salite!_â€ said the count, in the same tone in which he would have
given an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the least
hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a
bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of
the room.

â€œAh, it is you, Peppino,â€ said the count. But Peppino, instead of
answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the countâ€™s hand, and
covered it with kisses. â€œAh,â€ said the count, â€œyou have, then, not
forgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week
ago.â€

20203m



â€œNo, excellency; and never shall I forget it,â€ returned Peppino, with
an accent of profound gratitude.

â€œNever? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.
Rise and answer.â€

Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz.

â€œOh, you may speak before his excellency,â€ said he; â€œhe is one of my
friends. You allow me to give you this title?â€ continued the count in
French, â€œit is necessary to excite this manâ€™s confidence.â€

â€œYou can speak before me,â€ said Franz; â€œI am a friend of the countâ€™s.â€

â€œGood!â€ returned Peppino. â€œI am ready to answer any questions your
excellency may address to me.â€

â€œHow did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigiâ€™s hands?â€

â€œExcellency, the Frenchmanâ€™s carriage passed several times the one in
which was Teresa.â€

â€œThe chiefâ€™s mistress?â€

â€œYes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned itâ€”all this
with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.â€

â€œWhat?â€ cried Franz, â€œwas Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman
peasants?â€

â€œIt was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,â€ replied Peppino.

â€œWell?â€ said the count.

â€œWell, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chiefâ€™s
consent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa
gave him oneâ€”only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps
of the church of San Giacomo.â€

â€œWhat!â€ exclaimed Franz, â€œthe peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_
from himâ€”â€”â€

â€œWas a lad of fifteen,â€ replied Peppino. â€œBut it was no disgrace to
your friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of
others.â€

â€œAnd Beppo led him outside the walls?â€ said the count.

â€œExactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello.
Beppo got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait
to be asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo,
and sat by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a
league from Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the
end of the world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta
San Paolo; and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the
Frenchman became somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to
his head, the coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time,
four of the band, who were concealed on the banks of the Almo,
surrounded the carriage. The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly
strangled Beppo; but he could not resist five armed men, and was forced
to yield. They made him get out, walk along the banks of the river, and
then brought him to Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the
catacombs of St. Sebastian.â€

â€œWell,â€ said the count, turning towards Franz, â€œit seems to me that
this is a very likely story. What do you say to it?â€

â€œWhy, that I should think it very amusing,â€ replied Franz, â€œif it had
happened to anyone but poor Albert.â€

â€œAnd, in truth, if you had not found me here,â€ said the count, â€œit
might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend
dear; but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious
consequence.â€

â€œAnd shall we go and find him?â€ inquired Franz.

â€œOh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque placeâ€”do you know the
catacombs of St. Sebastian?â€

â€œI was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.â€

â€œWell, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be
difficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œThat is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.â€

â€œAlways ready?â€

â€œYes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that
sometimes when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the
night, I resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.â€

The count rang, and a footman appeared.

â€œOrder out the carriage,â€ he said, â€œand remove the pistols which are in
the holsters. You need not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.â€

In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage
stopped at the door. The count took out his watch.

â€œHalf-past twelve,â€ he said. â€œWe might start at five oâ€™clock and be in
time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night, and
therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the
hands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?â€

â€œMore determined than ever.â€

â€œWell, then, come along.â€

Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the
door they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz
recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the
count got into the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and
they set off at a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and
went down the Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San
Gregorio, and reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter
raised some difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a
permit from the governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the
city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore
raised, the porter had a louis for his trouble, and they went on their
way.

The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way,
and bordered with tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon,
which began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a
sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat
into the darkness on a signal from Peppino.

A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage
stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count and Franz alighted.

â€œIn ten minutes,â€ said the count to his companion, â€œwe shall be there.â€

He then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and
Peppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the
carriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd
going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken
surface of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the
tall red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous
lion.

â€œNow,â€ said the count, â€œlet us follow him.â€

Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path,
which, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to
the bottom of a small valley. They then perceived two men conversing in
the obscurity.

â€œOught we to go on?â€ asked Franz of the count; â€œor should we pause?â€

â€œLet us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.â€

One of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout.
Franz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them.

â€œYour excellency,â€ said Peppino, addressing the count, â€œif you will
follow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.â€

â€œGo on, then,â€ replied the count. They came to an opening behind a
clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man
could scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they
got along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his
torch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first
reached an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway
sloped in a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz
and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were
scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred
and fifty paces in this way, and then were stopped by, â€œWho comes
there?â€ At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a
carbine barrel.

â€œA friend!â€ responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry,
he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first,
saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.

Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the
count descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five
corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into
niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of
coffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of
the corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of
light were visible. The count laid his hand on Franzâ€™s shoulder.

â€œWould you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?â€ he inquired.

â€œExceedingly,â€ replied Franz.

â€œCome with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.â€ Peppino obeyed, and
Franz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in
advance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out
his torch, was visible along the wall.

They advanced silently, the count guiding Franz as if he had the
singular faculty of seeing in the dark. Franz himself, however, saw his
way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light, which
served in some manner as a guide. Three arcades were before them, and
the middle one was used as a door. These arcades opened on one side
into the corridor where the count and Franz were, and on the other into
a large square chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those
of which we have spoken.

In the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly
served as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still
surmounted them. A lamp, placed at the base of a pillar, lighted up
with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented
itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow.

A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading
with his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the
new-comers contemplated him. This was the chief of the band, Luigi
Vampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in
their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which
went all round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or
more, each having his carbine within reach. At the other end, silent,
scarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up
and down before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in
that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere.

When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque
tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent,
and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the
columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced
towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not
hear the noise of his footsteps.

â€œWho comes there?â€ cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who
saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this
challenge, Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from
his girdle. In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty
carbines were levelled at the count.

â€œWell,â€ said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his
countenance disturbed, â€œwell, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you
receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.â€

20207m



â€œGround arms,â€ exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the
hand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then,
turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said,
â€œYour pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the
honor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.â€

â€œIt seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,â€ said
the count, â€œand that not only do you forget peopleâ€™s faces, but also
the conditions you make with them.â€

â€œWhat conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?â€ inquired the
bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is
anxious to repair it.

â€œWas it not agreed,â€ asked the count, â€œthat not only my person, but
also that of my friends, should be respected by you?â€

â€œAnd how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?â€

â€œYou have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount
Albert de Morcerf. Well,â€ continued the count, in a tone that made
Franz shudder, â€œthis young gentleman is one of _my friends_â€”this young
gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfâ€”this young gentleman has
been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and
yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him
hither, and,â€ added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, â€œyou
have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.â€

â€œWhy did you not tell me all thisâ€”you?â€ inquired the brigand chief,
turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. â€œWhy have
you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the
count, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens! if I thought one
of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency,
I would blow his brains out with my own hand!â€

20211m



â€œWell,â€ said the count, turning towards Franz, â€œI told you there was
some mistake in this.â€

â€œAre you not alone?â€ asked Vampa with uneasiness.

â€œI am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I
desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your
excellency,â€ the count added, turning to Franz, â€œhere is Luigi Vampa,
who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has
committed.â€

Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him.

â€œWelcome among us, your excellency,â€ he said to him; â€œyou heard what
the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for
the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friendâ€™s ransom,
that this had happened.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Franz, looking round him uneasily, â€œwhere is the
viscount?â€”I do not see him.â€

â€œNothing has happened to him, I hope,â€ said the count frowningly.

â€œThe prisoner is there,â€ replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in
front of which the bandit was on guard, â€œand I will go myself and tell
him he is free.â€

The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albertâ€™s prison,
and Franz and the count followed him.

â€œWhat is the prisoner doing?â€ inquired Vampa of the sentinel.

â€œ_Ma foi_, captain,â€ replied the sentry, â€œI do not know; for the last
hour I have not heard him stir.â€

â€œCome in, your excellency,â€ said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended
seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened a
door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the
columbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of
the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber.

â€œCome,â€ said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, â€œnot so
bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oâ€™clock tomorrow morning.â€

Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible
to such a proof of courage.

â€œYou are right, your excellency,â€ he said; â€œthis must be one of your
friends.â€

Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, â€œWill
your excellency please to awaken?â€

Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.

â€œOh,â€ said he, â€œis it you, captain? You should have allowed me to
sleep. I had such a delightful dream. I was dancing the galop at
Torloniaâ€™s with the Countess Gâ€”â€”.â€ Then he drew his watch from his
pocket, that he might see how time sped.

â€œHalf-past one only?â€ said he. â€œWhy the devil do you rouse me at this
hour?â€

â€œTo tell you that you are free, your excellency.â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, â€œremember,
for the future, Napoleonâ€™s maxim, â€˜Never awaken me but for bad news;â€™
if you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have
been grateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?â€

â€œNo, your excellency.â€

â€œWell, then, how am I free?â€

â€œA person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.â€

â€œCome hither?â€

â€œYes, hither.â€

â€œReally? Then that person is a most amiable person.â€

Albert looked around and perceived Franz. â€œWhat,â€ said he, â€œis it you,
my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?â€

â€œNo, not I,â€ replied Franz, â€œbut our neighbor, the Count of Monte
Cristo.â€

â€œOh, my dear count,â€ said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and
wristbands, â€œyou are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me
as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the
carriage, and in the next for this visit,â€ and he put out his hand to
the count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did
give it.

The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently
accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was
one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz,
he was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national
honor in the presence of the bandit.

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ he said, â€œif you will make haste, we shall yet have
time to finish the night at Torloniaâ€™s. You may conclude your
interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to Signor Luigi,
who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.â€

â€œYou are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two oâ€™clock.
Signor Luigi,â€ continued Albert, â€œis there any formality to fulfil
before I take leave of your excellency?â€

â€œNone, sir,â€ replied the bandit, â€œyou are as free as air.â€

â€œWell, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.â€

And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,
crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.

â€œPeppino,â€ said the brigand chief, â€œgive me the torch.â€

â€œWhat are you going to do?â€ inquired the count.

â€œI will show you the way back myself,â€ said the captain; â€œthat is the
least honor that I can render to your excellency.â€

And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he
preceded his guests, not as a servant who performs an act of civility,
but like a king who precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he
bowed.

â€œAnd now, your excellency,â€ added he, â€œallow me to repeat my apologies,
and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred.â€

â€œNo, my dear Vampa,â€ replied the count; â€œbesides, you compensate for
your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to
you for having committed them.â€

20214m



â€œGentlemen,â€ added the chief, turning towards the young men, â€œperhaps
the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever
feel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be
welcome.â€

Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert. Franz
paused for a moment.

â€œHas your excellency anything to ask me?â€ said Vampa with a smile.

â€œYes, I have,â€ replied Franz; â€œI am curious to know what work you were
perusing with so much attention as we entered.â€

â€œCÃ¦sarâ€™s _Commentaries_,â€ said the bandit, â€œit is my favorite work.â€

â€œWell, are you coming?â€ asked Albert.

â€œYes,â€ replied Franz, â€œhere I am,â€ and he, in his turn, left the caves.
They advanced to the plain.

â€œAh, your pardon,â€ said Albert, turning round; â€œwill you allow me,
captain?â€

And he lighted his cigar at Vampaâ€™s torch.

â€œNow, my dear count,â€ he said, â€œlet us on with all the speed we may. I
am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccianoâ€™s.â€

They found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word
in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed.

It was just two oâ€™clock by Albertâ€™s watch when the two friends entered
into the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they
entered together, all uneasiness on Albertâ€™s account ceased instantly.

â€œMadame,â€ said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess,
â€œyesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am
rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend,
whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the
delay arose from no fault of mine.â€

And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz,
Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and disappeared
with her in the whirl of dancers.

In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had
passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been,
in some sort, forced to give his hand to Albert.



 Chapter 38. The Rendezvous

The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following
morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit
to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked
the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered
could never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted by
some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was
strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to
be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious
personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection
to Albertâ€™s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot,
and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.

â€œMy dear count,â€ said Albert, advancing to meet him, â€œpermit me to
repeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the
remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory;
believe me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with
grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered
me; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.â€

â€œMy very good friend and excellent neighbor,â€ replied the count, with a
smile, â€œyou really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing
but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your
travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between
us;â€”but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and
unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the
perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.â€

â€œUpon my word,â€ said Albert, â€œI deserve no credit for what I could not
help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to
let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes
all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile
even in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing
to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in
my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you?
My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses
considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I
unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my
life is dear, at your disposal.â€

â€œMonsieur de Morcerf,â€ replied the count, â€œyour offer, far from
surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it
in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;â€”nay, I
will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to
ask a great favor at your hands.â€

â€œOh, pray name it.â€

â€œI am wholly a stranger to Parisâ€”it is a city I have never yet seen.â€

â€œIs it possible,â€ exclaimed Albert, â€œthat you have reached your present
age without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely
credit it.â€

â€œNevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking
that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to
me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all
probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty,
as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of
your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have
introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed
no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the
idea.â€

â€œSo distinguished an individual as yourself,â€ cried Albert, â€œcould
scarcely have required an introduction.â€

â€œYou are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I
possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in
the speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in
travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of
dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should
present itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,
smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de
Morcerfâ€ (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),
â€œwhether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the
doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or
a native of Cochin-China?â€

â€œOh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,â€ answered Albert; â€œand so
much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father
summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear
Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and
connected with the very cream of Parisian society.â€

â€œConnected by marriage, you mean,â€ said Franz, laughingly.

â€œWell, never mind how it is,â€ answered Albert, â€œit comes to the same
thing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be
quite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative
I shall make of all the domestic virtuesâ€”donâ€™t you think so? But as
regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say
that you may command me and mine to any extent you please.â€

â€œThen it is settled,â€ said the count, â€œand I give you my solemn
assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize
plans that I have long meditated.â€

Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the
count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while
the count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to
read something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was
inscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a
sphinx-like smile.

â€œBut tell me now, count,â€ exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of
having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; â€œtell me
truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris
is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we
make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built
on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?â€

â€œI pledge you my honor,â€ returned the count, â€œthat I mean to do as I
have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit
Paris.â€

â€œWhen do you propose going thither?â€

â€œHave you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?â€

â€œCertainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeksâ€™ time, that is to say,
as fast as I can get there!â€

â€œNay,â€ said the Count; â€œI will give you three months ere I join you;
you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.

â€œAnd in three monthsâ€™ time,â€ said Albert, â€œyou will be at my house?â€

â€œShall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?â€
inquired the count; â€œonly let me warn you that I am proverbial for my
punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.â€

â€œDay for day, hour for hour,â€ said Albert; â€œthat will suit me to a
dot.â€

â€œSo be it, then,â€ replied the count, and extending his hand towards a
calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, â€œtoday is the 21st
of February;â€ and drawing out his watch, added, â€œit is exactly
half-past ten oâ€™clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me
the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.â€

â€œCapital!â€ exclaimed Albert; â€œyour breakfast shall be waiting.â€

â€œWhere do you live?â€

â€œNo. 27, Rue du Helder.â€

â€œHave you bachelorâ€™s apartments there? I hope my coming will not put
you to any inconvenience.â€

â€œI reside in my fatherâ€™s house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther
side of the courtyard, entirely separated from the main building.â€

â€œQuite sufficient,â€ replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he
wrote down â€œNo. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the
morning.â€

â€œNow then,â€ said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, â€œmake
yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more
accurate in marking the time than myself.â€

â€œShall I see you again ere my departure?â€ asked Albert.

â€œThat depends; when do you leave?â€

â€œTomorrow evening, at five oâ€™clock.â€

â€œIn that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to
Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday
morning. And you, baron,â€ pursued the count, addressing Franz, â€œdo you
also depart tomorrow?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œFor France?â€

â€œNo, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.â€

â€œThen we shall not meet in Paris?â€

â€œI fear I shall not have that honor.â€

â€œWell, since we must part,â€ said the count, holding out a hand to each
of the young men, â€œallow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant
journey.â€

It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that
of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered
at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.

20219m



â€œLet us understand each other,â€ said Albert; â€œit is agreedâ€”is it
not?â€”that you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of
May, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for
your punctuality?â€

â€œThe 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No.
27,â€ replied the count.

The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to
their own apartments; â€œyou seem more than commonly thoughtful.â€

â€œI will confess to you, Albert,â€ replied Franz, â€œthe count is a very
singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris
fills me with a thousand apprehensions.â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ exclaimed Albert, â€œwhat can there possibly be in that
to excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses.â€

â€œWhether I am in my senses or not,â€ answered Franz, â€œthat is the way I
feel.â€

â€œListen to me, Franz,â€ said Albert; â€œI am glad that the occasion has
presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold
you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand,
has always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular
against him?â€

â€œPossibly.â€

â€œDid you ever meet him previously to coming hither?â€

â€œI have.â€

â€œAnd where?â€

â€œWill you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to
tell you?â€

â€œI promise.â€

â€œUpon your honor?â€

â€œUpon my honor.â€

â€œThen listen to me.â€

Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the
Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there,
and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with considerable
force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from
the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of
the _Thousand and One Nights_.

He recounted, with circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of
the supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his
awakening, there remained no proof or trace of all these events, save
the small yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail
toward Porto-Vecchio.

Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum,
between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain
the release of the bandit Peppino,â€”an engagement which, as our readers
are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.

At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the
embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient
cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and
finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and
satisfactory result that followed. Albert listened with the most
profound attention.

â€œWell,â€ said he, when Franz had concluded, â€œwhat do you find to object
to in all you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being
rich, possesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or
Southampton, and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts
belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense, and have
the same liking for this amusement. Now, by way of having a
resting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched
cookeryâ€”which has been trying its best to poison me during the last
four months, while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many
years,â€”and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, Monte
Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first
found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government
taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of
the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital,
he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name. Just ask
yourself, my good fellow, whether there are not many persons of our
acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in
their lives were masters of?â€

â€œBut,â€ said Franz, â€œthe Corsican bandits that were among the crew of
his vessel?â€

â€œWhy, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better
than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves,
but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from
their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no
disgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go
to Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or
prefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to
find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire
greatly.â€

â€œStill,â€ persisted Franz, â€œI suppose you will allow that such men as
Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than
plunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence
the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?â€

â€œMy good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that
influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its
source; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with
outlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there
may be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for
my own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for
saving me 4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more
nor less than 24,000 livres of our moneyâ€”a sum at which, most
assuredly, I should never have been estimated in France, proving most
indisputably,â€ added Albert with a laugh, â€œthat no prophet is honored
in his own country.â€

â€œTalking of countries,â€ replied Franz, â€œof what country is the count,
what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune,
and what were those events of his early lifeâ€”a life as marvellous as
unknownâ€”that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and
gloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your
place, I should like to have answered.â€

â€œMy dear Franz,â€ replied Albert, â€œwhen, upon receipt of my letter, you
found the necessity of asking the countâ€™s assistance, you promptly went
to him, saying, â€˜My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to
deliver him.â€™ Was not that nearly what you said?â€

20222m



â€œIt was.â€

â€œWell, then, did he ask you, â€˜Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he
come by his nameâ€”his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is
his birthplace? of what country is he a native?â€™ Tell me, did he put
all these questions to you?â€

â€œI confess he asked me none.â€

â€œNo; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where,
I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and
unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then,
Franz, when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he
but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian
prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Parisâ€”merely to
introduce him into societyâ€”would you have me refuse? My good fellow,
you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with
such cold-blooded policy.â€

And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of
affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments
were all on Albertâ€™s side.

â€œWell,â€ said Franz with a sigh, â€œdo as you please my dear viscount, for
your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of
all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular
personage.â€

â€œHe is a philanthropist,â€ answered the other; â€œand no doubt his motive
in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you
are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced
the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can
obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the
other. And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come,
shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peterâ€™s?â€

Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five
oâ€™clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris,
and Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.

But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his
expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed
in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the
Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de
Morcerf, he had written in pencil:

â€œ27, _Rue du Helder, on the_ 21_st May, half-past ten_ A.M.â€



 Chapter 39. The Guests

In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count
of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the
21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a
pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite
another building, in which were the servantsâ€™ apartments. Two windows
only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into
the court, and two at the back into the garden.

Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the
imperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the
Count and Countess of Morcerf.

A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at
intervals by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a
large gate of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A
small door, close to the lodge of the _concierge_, gave ingress and
egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot.

It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling
to part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscountâ€™s
age required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this
habitation for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of
what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with
the indolent, careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in
a gilded cage. By means of the two windows looking into the street,
Albert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is
necessary to young men, who always want to see the world traverse their
horizon, even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then,
should anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de
Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate,
similar to that close to the _conciergeâ€™s_ door, and which merits a
particular description.

It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since
the house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but
the well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was
a mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it
was free, and, like that famous portal in the _Arabian Nights_, opening
at the â€œ_Sesame_â€ of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a
cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest
voices or whitest fingers in the world.

At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and
which formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albertâ€™s
breakfast-room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon,
looking into the garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the
windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the
only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying
eyes of the curious could penetrate.

On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third,
formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a
boudoir, and a bedroom. The salon downstairs was only an Algerian
divan, for the use of smokers. The boudoir upstairs communicated with
the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident
that every precaution had been taken. Above this floor was a large
_atelier_, which had been increased in size by pulling down the
partitionsâ€”a pandemonium, in which the artist and the dandy strove for
pre-eminence.

There were collected and piled up all Albertâ€™s successive caprices,
hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutesâ€”a whole orchestra, for Albert had had
not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes,
pencilsâ€”for music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves,
broadswords, and single-sticksâ€”for, following the example of the
fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with
far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that
complete a dandyâ€™s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick;
and it was here that he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.

The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della
Robbia _faÃ¯ences_, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which
perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieuâ€”for two of
these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the
Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.

Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed
beneath Persiaâ€™s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta
or of Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to
say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to
their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their
golden and silky reflections.

In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet â€œbaby grandâ€ piano
in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its
narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the
_chefs-dâ€™Å“uvre_ of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, GrÃ©try, and
Porpora.

On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers,
Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits
of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their
flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks
forever open. This was Albertâ€™s favorite lounging place.

However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established
himself in the small salon downstairs. There, on a table, surrounded at
some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
known,â€”from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and
so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,â€”was
exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;
beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an
open cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their
amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their
long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the
smokers.

Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast
of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from
their mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.

At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom
named John, and who only spoke English, all Albertâ€™s establishment,
although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great
occasions the countâ€™s _chasseur_ also. This valet, whose name was
Germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master,
held in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of
letters, which he gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the
different missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand,
and enclosed in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their
contents with some attention.

â€œHow did these letters come?â€ said he.

â€œOne by the post, Madame Danglarsâ€™ footman left the other.â€

â€œLet Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her
box. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera
I will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different
wineâ€”Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get
them at Borelâ€™s, and be sure you say they are for me.â€

â€œAt what oâ€™clock, sir, do you breakfast?â€

20227m



â€œWhat time is it now?â€

â€œA quarter to ten.â€

â€œVery well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to
the ministerâ€”and besidesâ€ (Albert looked at his tablets), â€œit is the
hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not
much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the countess up
yet?â€

â€œIf you wish, I will inquire.â€

â€œYes, ask her for one of her _liqueur_ cellarets, mine is incomplete;
and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three oâ€™clock,
and that I request permission to introduce someone to her.â€

The valet left the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off
the cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre
announcements, made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet;
hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of
which he had heard, and threw down, one after the other, the three
leading papers of Paris, muttering,

â€œThese papers become more and more stupid every day.â€

A moment after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant
announced M. Lucien Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear
gray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with
beautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell
eye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the
superciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with
a half-official air, without smiling or speaking.

â€œGood-morning, Lucien, good-morning,â€ said Albert; â€œyour punctuality
really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You, whom I expected
last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was
half-past! Has the ministry resigned?â€

â€œNo, my dear fellow,â€ returned the young man, seating himself on the
divan; â€œreassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,
and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,
and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us.â€

â€œAh, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.â€

â€œNo, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to the
other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at
Bourges.â€

â€œAt Bourges?â€

â€œYes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles
VII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day
before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do
not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as
soon as we do) made a million!â€

â€œAnd you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your
button-hole.â€

â€œYes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,â€ returned Debray
carelessly.

â€œCome, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have
it.â€

â€œOh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat on a
black coat buttoned up.â€

â€œAnd makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt.â€

â€œIt is for that reason you see me so early.â€

â€œBecause you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce
the good news to me?â€

â€œNo, because I passed the night writing letters,â€”five-and-twenty
despatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my
head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de
Boulogne, _ennui_ and hunger attacked me at once,â€”two enemies who
rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort
of Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast
this morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse
me.â€

â€œIt is my duty as your host,â€ returned Albert, ringing the bell, while
Lucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers that lay on
the table. â€œGermain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In the meantime,
my dear Lucien, here are cigarsâ€”contraband, of courseâ€”try them, and
persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with
cabbage leaves.â€

â€œ_Peste!_ I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from
government you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not
concern the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M.
Humann, section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.â€

â€œOn my word,â€ said Albert, â€œyou astonish me by the extent of your
knowledge. Take a cigar.â€

â€œReally, my dear Albert,â€ replied Lucien, lighting a manilla at a
rose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standâ€”â€œhow
happy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good
fortune!â€

â€œAnd what would you do, my dear diplomatist,â€ replied Morcerf, with a
slight degree of irony in his voice, â€œif you did nothing? What? private
secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and
Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to
protect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your
cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his
battle-fields with his sword and his victories; possessing
five-and-twenty thousand francs a year, besides your place; a horse,
for which ChÃ¢teau-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you
would not part with; a tailor who never disappoints you; with the
opera, the jockey-club, and other diversions, can you not amuse
yourself? Well, I will amuse you.â€

â€œHow?â€

â€œBy introducing to you a new acquaintance.â€

â€œA man or a woman?â€

â€œA man.â€

â€œI know so many men already.â€

â€œBut you do not know this man.â€

â€œWhere does he come fromâ€”the end of the world?â€

â€œFarther still, perhaps.â€

â€œThe deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.â€

â€œOh, no; our breakfast comes from my fatherâ€™s kitchen. Are you hungry?â€

â€œHumiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de
Villefortâ€™s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would
think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?â€

â€œAh, depreciate other personsâ€™ dinners; you ministers give such
splendid ones.â€

â€œYes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced to
entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with
us, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.â€

â€œWell, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.â€

â€œWillingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite right
to pacify that country.â€

â€œYes; but Don Carlos?â€

â€œWell, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry
his son to the little queen.â€

â€œYou will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the
ministry.â€

â€œI think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
this morning.â€

â€œWell, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I hear
Beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will
pass away the time.â€

â€œAbout what?â€

â€œAbout the papers.â€

â€œMy dear friend,â€ said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, â€œdo I
ever read the papers?â€

â€œThen you will dispute the more.â€

â€œM. Beauchamp,â€ announced the servant. â€œCome in, come in,â€ said Albert,
rising and advancing to meet the young man. â€œHere is Debray, who
detests you without reading you, so he says.â€

â€œHe is quite right,â€ returned Beauchamp; â€œfor I criticise him without
knowing what he does. Good-day, commander!â€

â€œAh, you know that already,â€ said the private secretary, smiling and
shaking hands with him.

â€œ_Pardieu!_â€

â€œAnd what do they say of it in the world?â€

â€œIn which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.â€

â€œIn the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.â€

â€œThey say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought
to reap a little blue.â€

â€œCome, come, that is not bad!â€ said Lucien. â€œWhy do you not join our
party, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make your fortune
in three or four years.â€

â€œI only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
minister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,
for I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must
go to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.â€

â€œYou only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive
we shall sit down to table.â€



 Chapter 40. The Breakfast

And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?â€ said Beauchamp.

â€œA gentleman, and a diplomatist.â€

â€œThen we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three for
the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some
strawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to
the Chamber.â€

â€œDo not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,
and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the
meantime, follow Debrayâ€™s example, and take a glass of sherry and a
biscuit.â€

â€œBe it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.â€

â€œYou are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is
out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.â€

â€œAh, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this
morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and
at his wifeâ€™s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of
France. The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had
our choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?â€

â€œI understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.â€

â€œDo not run down M. Danglarsâ€™ speeches,â€ said Debray; â€œhe votes for
you, for he belongs to the opposition.â€

â€œ_Pardieu_, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you
send him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.â€

â€œMy dear friend,â€ said Albert to Beauchamp, â€œit is plain that the
affairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor
this morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage
between myself and Mlle. EugÃ©nie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,
therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say
to me, â€˜Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.â€™â€

â€œAh, this marriage will never take place,â€ said Beauchamp. â€œThe king
has made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a
gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for
the paltry sum of two million francs, to a _mÃ©salliance_. The Viscount
of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.â€

â€œBut two million francs make a nice little sum,â€ replied Morcerf.

â€œIt is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad
from the Jardin des Plantes to La RÃ¢pÃ©e.â€

â€œNever mind what he says, Morcerf,â€ said Debray, â€œdo you marry her. You
marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter?
It is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have
seven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will
still have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly
became King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.â€

â€œOn my word, I think you are right, Lucien,â€ said Albert absently.

â€œTo be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastardâ€”that
is, he can be.â€

â€œDo not say that, Debray,â€ returned Beauchamp, laughing, â€œfor here is
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass
the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.â€

â€œHe will sully it then,â€ returned Lucien; â€œfor I am lowâ€”very low.â€

â€œOh, heavens,â€ cried Beauchamp, â€œthe minister quotes BÃ©ranger, what
shall we come to next?â€

â€œM. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaudâ€”M. Maximilian Morrel,â€ said the servant,
announcing two fresh guests.

â€œNow, then, to breakfast,â€ said Beauchamp; â€œfor, if I remember, you
told me you only expected two persons, Albert.â€

â€œMorrel,â€ muttered Albertâ€”â€œMorrelâ€”who is he?â€

But before he had finished, M. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, a handsome young man
of thirty, gentleman all over,â€”that is, with the figure of a Guiche and
the wit of a Mortemart,â€”took Albertâ€™s hand.

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ said he, â€œlet me introduce to you M. Maximilian
Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is moreâ€”however the man
speaks for himselfâ€”my preserver. Salute my hero, viscount.â€

And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and
dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black
moustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under
circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten. A rich
uniform, half French, half Oriental, set off his graceful and stalwart
figure, and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion
of Honor. The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness.

â€œMonsieur,â€ said Albert with affectionate courtesy, â€œthe count of
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me;
you are his friend, be ours also.â€

â€œWell said,â€ interrupted ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œand pray that, if you should
ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did
for me.â€

â€œWhat has he done?â€ asked Albert.

â€œOh, nothing worth speaking of,â€ said Morrel; â€œM. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud
exaggerates.â€

â€œNot worth speaking of?â€ cried ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œlife is not worth
speaking of!â€”that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel. It
is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who
only did so onceâ€”â€”â€

â€œWe gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life.â€

â€œExactly so.â€

â€œOn what occasion?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œBeauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,â€ said Debray: â€œdo
not set him off on some long story.â€

â€œWell, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,â€ replied Beauchamp,
â€œChÃ¢teau-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.â€

â€œGentlemen,â€ said Morcerf, â€œit is only a quarter past ten, and I expect
someone else.â€

â€œAh, true, a diplomatist!â€ observed Debray.

â€œDiplomat or not, I donâ€™t know; I only know that he charged himself on
my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my
satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him
knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden
Fleece and the Garter.â€

â€œWell, since we are not to sit down to table,â€ said Debray, â€œtake a
glass of sherry, and tell us all about it.â€

â€œYou all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.â€

â€œIt is a road your ancestors have traced for you,â€ said Albert
gallantly.

â€œYes? but I doubt that your object was like theirsâ€”to rescue the Holy
Sepulchre.â€

â€œYou are quite right, Beauchamp,â€ observed the young aristocrat. â€œIt
was only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear duelling ever since two
seconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the
arm of one of my best friends, one whom you all knowâ€”poor Franz
dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

â€œAh, true,â€ said Debray, â€œyou did fight some time ago; about what?â€

20235m



â€œThe devil take me, if I remember,â€ returned ChÃ¢teau-Renaud. â€œBut I
recollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let such
talents as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols
that had been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went
from thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the
raising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight-and-forty
hours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the night
tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor
bruteâ€”accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable,
the Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in
Arabia.â€

â€œThatâ€™s why you want to purchase my English horse,â€ said Debray, â€œyou
think he will bear the cold better.â€

â€œYou are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.â€

â€œYou were very much frightened, then?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œWell, yes, and I had good reason to be so,â€ replied ChÃ¢teau-Renaud. â€œI
was retreating on foot, for my horse was dead. Six Arabs came up, full
gallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my double-barrelled gun,
and two more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were
still left; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so
short, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan,
and I already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom
you see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and
cleft the skull of the other with his sabre. He had assigned himself
the task of saving a manâ€™s life that day; chance caused that man to be
myself. When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or
Marochetti.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Morrel, smiling, â€œit was the 5th of September, the
anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved;
therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by
someâ€”â€”â€

20237m



â€œHeroic action,â€ interrupted ChÃ¢teau-Renaud. â€œI was chosen. But that is
not allâ€”after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,
not by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the
whole; then from hunger by sharing with meâ€”guess what?â€

â€œA Strasbourg pie?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œNo, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
appetite. It was very hard.â€

â€œThe horse?â€ said Morcerf, laughing.

â€œNo, the sacrifice,â€ returned ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œask Debray if he would
sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?â€

â€œNot for a stranger,â€ said Debray, â€œbut for a friend I might, perhaps.â€

â€œI divined that you would become mine, count,â€ replied Morrel;
â€œbesides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or
not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the
favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.â€

â€œThe history to which M. Morrel alludes,â€ continued ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œis
an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better
acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our
memories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?â€

â€œAt half-past ten.â€

â€œPrecisely?â€ asked Debray, taking out his watch.

â€œOh, you will give me five minutesâ€™ grace,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œfor I
also expect a preserver.â€

â€œOf whom?â€

â€œOf myself,â€ cried Morcerf; â€œ_parbleu!_ do you think I cannot be saved
as well as anyone else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off
heads? Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at
tableâ€”at least, I hope soâ€”two benefactors of humanity.â€

â€œWhat shall we do?â€ said Debray; â€œwe have only one Monthyon prize.â€

â€œWell, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,â€
said Beauchamp; â€œthat is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the
dilemma.â€

â€œAnd where does he come from?â€ asked Debray. â€œYou have already answered
the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second
time.â€

â€œReally,â€ said Albert, â€œI do not know; when I invited him three months
ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may
have gone?â€

â€œAnd you think him capable of being exact?â€ demanded Debray.

â€œI think him capable of everything.â€

â€œWell, with the five minutesâ€™ grace, we have only ten left.â€

â€œI will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.â€

â€œI beg pardon,â€ interrupted Beauchamp; â€œare there any materials for an
article in what you are going to tell us?â€

â€œYes, and for a most curious one.â€

â€œGo on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning,
and I must make up for it.â€

â€œI was at Rome during the last Carnival.â€

â€œWe know that,â€ said Beauchamp.

â€œYes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.â€

â€œThere are no bandits,â€ cried Debray.

â€œYes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I
found them ugly enough to frighten me.â€

â€œCome, my dear Albert,â€ said Debray, â€œconfess that your cook is
behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes,
and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish
by a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse
you, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.â€

â€œAnd I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one
from beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted
me to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.â€

â€œI know it,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œI narrowly escaped catching a fever
there.â€

â€œAnd I did more than that,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œfor I caught one. I was
informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman
crownsâ€”about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. I was
at the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to Franzâ€”and were he
here he would confirm every wordâ€”I wrote then to Franz that if he did
not come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past
I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in
whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such
was the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously
kept his word.â€

â€œBut Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,â€ said
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud. â€œA man whose name is Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay or Albert de
Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.â€

â€œNo, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present
to you.â€

â€œAh, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing
Andromeda.â€

â€œNo, he is a man about my own size.â€

â€œArmed to the teeth?â€

â€œHe had not even a knitting-needle.â€

â€œBut he paid your ransom?â€

â€œHe said two words to the chief and I was free.â€

â€œAnd they apologized to him for having carried you off?â€ said
Beauchamp.

â€œJust so.â€

â€œWhy, he is a second Ariosto.â€

â€œNo, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.â€

â€œThere is no Count of Monte Cristoâ€ said Debray.

â€œI do not think so,â€ added ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, with the air of a man who
knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.

â€œDoes anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?â€

â€œHe comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors
possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.â€

â€œI think I can assist your researches,â€ said Maximilian. â€œMonte Cristo
is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my
father employedâ€”a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an
atom in the infinite.â€

â€œPrecisely!â€ cried Albert. â€œWell, he of whom I speak is the lord and
master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title
of count somewhere in Tuscany.â€

â€œHe is rich, then?â€

â€œI believe so.â€

â€œBut that ought to be visible.â€

â€œThat is what deceives you, Debray.â€

â€œI do not understand you.â€

â€œHave you read the _Arabian Nights_?â€

â€œWhat a question!â€

â€œWell, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor
fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with
the wealth of the Indies.â€

â€œWhich means?â€

â€œWhich means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen.
He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad
the Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.â€

â€œAnd you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œNo, but Franz has; for heavenâ€™s sake, not a word of this before him.
Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and
by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is not quite
sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken
hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of
statues.â€

The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,â€”â€œAre you mad, or are
you laughing at us?â€

â€œAnd I also,â€ said Morrel thoughtfully, â€œhave heard something like this
from an old sailor named Penelon.â€

â€œAh,â€ cried Albert, â€œit is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me;
you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the
labyrinth?â€

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ said Debray, â€œwhat you tell us is so extraordinary.â€

â€œAh, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of
themâ€”they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering in
the affairs of their countrymen who travel.â€

â€œNow you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have them
protect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that
now they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send
you to Constantinople.â€

â€œNo, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali,
the Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.â€

â€œYou say very true,â€ responded Debray.

â€œYes,â€ said Albert, â€œbut this has nothing to do with the existence of
the Count of Monte Cristo.â€

â€œ_Pardieu!_ everyone exists.â€

â€œDoubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a
princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and
Greek mistresses.â€

â€œHave you seen the Greek mistress?â€

â€œI have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard
her one morning when I breakfasted with the count.â€

â€œHe eats, then?â€

â€œYes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.â€

â€œHe must be a vampire.â€

â€œLaugh, if you will; the Countess Gâ€”â€”, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared
that the count was a vampire.â€

â€œAh, capital,â€ said Beauchamp. â€œFor a man not connected with
newspapers, here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the
_Constitutionnel_.â€

â€œWild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,â€ said
Debray; â€œfacial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid
complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness
unexceptionable.â€

â€œJust so, Lucien,â€ returned Morcerf; â€œyou have described him feature
for feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has often made
me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I thought I
should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he
spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the
executioner and the culprit.â€

â€œDid he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your
blood?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œOr, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?â€

â€œRail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,â€ said Morcerf, somewhat
piqued. â€œWhen I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand
or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are
not of the same race.â€

â€œI am highly flattered,â€ returned Beauchamp.

â€œAt the same time,â€ added ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œyour Count of Monte Cristo
is a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with
the Italian banditti.â€

â€œThere are no Italian banditti,â€ said Debray.

â€œNo vampire,â€ cried Beauchamp.

â€œNo Count of Monte Cristoâ€ added Debray. â€œThere is half-past ten
striking, Albert.â€

20243m



â€œConfess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,â€
continued Beauchamp.

But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced,
â€œHis excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.â€ The involuntary start
everyone gave proved how much Morcerfâ€™s narrative had impressed them,
and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden
emotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the street, or steps in
the antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly. The count
appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but the most fastidious
dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet. Every article
of dressâ€”hat, coat, gloves, and bootsâ€”was from the first makers. He
seemed scarcely five-and-thirty. But what struck everybody was his
extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn. The count
advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached Albert,
who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner.

â€œPunctuality,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œis the politeness of kings,
according to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it is not the same
with travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two or three
seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be
accomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it
seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.â€

â€œMy dear count,â€ replied Albert, â€œI was announcing your visit to some
of my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did
me the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They are the Count
of ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and
whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray,
private secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an
editor of a paper, and the terror of the French government, but of
whom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in
Italy, since his paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel,
captain of Spahis.â€

At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with
courtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a
pace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.

â€œYou wear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,â€ said he;
â€œit is a handsome uniform.â€

No one could have said what caused the countâ€™s voice to vibrate so
deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear,
lustrous, and limpid when he pleased.

â€œYou have never seen our Africans, count?â€ said Albert.

â€œNever,â€ replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of
himself again.

â€œWell, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts
in the whole army.â€

â€œOh, M. de Morcerf,â€ interrupted Morrel.

â€œLet me go on, captain. And we have just heard,â€ continued Albert, â€œof
a new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I have seen him
today for the first time, I request you to allow me to introduce him as
my friend.â€

At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the
concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid
that show emotion.

â€œAh, you have a noble heart,â€ said the count; â€œso much the better.â€

This exclamation, which corresponded to the countâ€™s own thought rather
than to what Albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially
Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder. But, at the same time,
the intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem,
it was impossible to be offended at it.

20245m



â€œWhy should he doubt it?â€ said Beauchamp to ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œIn reality,â€ replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and
his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
penetrable in Monte Cristo, â€œAlbert has not deceived us, for the count
is a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of
the singular remark he has made about me.â€

â€œGentlemen,â€ said Albert, â€œGermain informs me that breakfast is ready.
My dear count, allow me to show you the way.â€ They passed silently into
the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.

â€œGentlemen,â€ said the count, seating himself, â€œpermit me to make a
confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may
commit. I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is
the first time I have ever been at Paris. The French way of living is
utterly unknown to me, and up to the present time I have followed the
Eastern customs, which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian. I beg
you, therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too
Italian, or too Arabian. Now, then, let us breakfast.â€

â€œWith what an air he says all this,â€ muttered Beauchamp; â€œdecidedly he
is a great man.â€

â€œA great man in his own country,â€ added Debray.

â€œA great man in every country, M. Debray,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

The count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert
remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian
mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential
point.

â€œMy dear count,â€ said he, â€œI fear one thing, and that is, that the fare
of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza
di Spagna. I ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had
some dishes prepared expressly.â€

â€œDid you know me better,â€ returned the count, smiling, â€œyou would not
give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who has
successively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla
podrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and
swallowsâ€™ nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only I
eat but little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of
appetite, is my day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday
morning.â€

â€œWhat,â€ cried all the guests, â€œyou have not eaten for four-and-twenty
hours?â€

â€œNo,â€ replied the count; â€œI was forced to go out of my road to obtain
some information near NÃ®mes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore
I did not choose to stop.â€

â€œAnd you ate in your carriage?â€ asked Morcerf.

â€œNo, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the
courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined
to eat.â€

â€œBut you can sleep when you please, monsieur?â€ said Morrel.

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou have a recipe for it?â€

â€œAn infallible one.â€

â€œThat would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food
to eat, and rarely anything to drink.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œbut, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a
man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might
not awake when it was needed.â€

â€œMay we inquire what is this recipe?â€ asked Debray.

â€œOh, yes,â€ returned Monte Cristo; â€œI make no secret of it. It is a
mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order
to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the Eastâ€”that is,
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed
in equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is
taken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay; I think he
tasted them one day.â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œhe said something about it to me.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
incredulous, â€œyou always carry this drug about you?â€

â€œAlways.â€

â€œWould it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?â€
continued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.

â€œNo, monsieur,â€ returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a
marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a
golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored
pellet about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating
odor. There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain
about a dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to
examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from
hand to hand.

â€œAnd is it your cook who prepares these pills?â€ asked Beauchamp.

â€œOh, no, monsieur,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œI do not thus betray my
enjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my
pills myself.â€

â€œThis is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,â€ said
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œalthough my mother has some remarkable family jewels.â€

â€œI had three similar ones,â€ returned Monte Cristo. â€œI gave one to the
Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the
Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large,
though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor,
Pius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which
reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I
intended.â€

Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so
much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was
mad. However, the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to
the former belief.

â€œAnd what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these
magnificent presents?â€ asked Debray.

â€œThe Sultan, the liberty of a woman,â€ replied the Count; â€œthe Pope, the
life of a man; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if
heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne.â€

â€œAnd it was Peppino you saved, was it not?â€ cried Morcerf; â€œit was for
him that you obtained pardon?â€

â€œPerhaps,â€ returned the count, smiling.

â€œMy dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you
speak thus,â€ said Morcerf. â€œI had announced you beforehand to my
friends as an enchanter of the _Arabian Nights_, a wizard of the Middle
Ages; but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake
for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when
these truths do not form a part of their daily existence. For example,
here is Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, â€˜A
member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the
Boulevard;â€™ â€˜four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St. Denisâ€™
or â€˜the Faubourg St. Germain;â€™ â€˜ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have
been arrested in a _cafÃ©_ on the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes
de Julien,â€™â€”and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in
the Maremma, the Campagna di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them
yourself that I was taken by bandits, and that without your generous
intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St.
Sebastian, instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du
Helder.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œyou promised me never to mention that
circumstance.â€

â€œIt was not I who made that promise,â€ cried Morcerf; â€œit must have been
someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you
have forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust, relate
the little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.â€

â€œIt seems to me,â€ returned the count, smiling, â€œthat you played a
sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.â€

20249m



â€œWell, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your turn,
all that I do not know?â€

â€œThat is but fair,â€ replied Monte Cristo.

â€œWell,â€ said Morcerf, â€œfor three days I believed myself the object of
the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or
PoppÃ¦a, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a
_contadina_, and I say _contadina_ to avoid saying peasant girl. What I
know is, that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just
now, I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or
sixteen, with a beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was
about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my
head, and, aided by seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me,
to the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated
brigand chief perusing CÃ¦sarâ€™s _Commentaries_, and who deigned to leave
off reading to inform me, that unless the next morning, before six
oâ€™clock, four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his
bankerâ€™s, at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist. The
letter is still to be seen, for it is in Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinayâ€™s possession,
signed by me, and with a postscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I
know, but I know not, count, how you contrived to inspire so much
respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect
for anything. I assure you, Franz and I were lost in admiration.â€

â€œNothing more simple,â€ returned the count. â€œI had known the famous
Vampa for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and only a
shepherd, I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he,
in order to repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had
carved with his own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection
of arms. In after years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of
presents, which ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he
did not recollect me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it
was I who captured him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him
over to Roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would
have been particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sortâ€”I
suffered him and his band to depart.â€

â€œWith the condition that they should sin no more,â€ said Beauchamp,
laughing. â€œI see they kept their promise.â€

â€œNo, monsieur,â€ returned Monte Cristo â€œupon the simple condition that
they should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to
say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and
your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which
does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies
itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place
in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society
and my neighbor who are indebted to me.â€

â€œBravo,â€ cried ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œyou are the first man I ever met
sufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!â€

â€œIt is frank, at least,â€ said Morrel. â€œBut I am sure that the count
does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so
boldly avowed.â€

â€œHow have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?â€ asked Monte
Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,
that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
clear and piercing glance.

â€œWhy, it seems to me,â€ replied Morrel, â€œthat in delivering M. de
Morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to
society.â€

â€œOf which he is the brightest ornament,â€ said Beauchamp, drinking off a
glass of champagne.

â€œMy dear count,â€ cried Morcerf, â€œyou are at faultâ€”you, one of the most
formidable logicians I knowâ€”and you must see it clearly proved that
instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call
yourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family
name is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,
and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display
the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric
Parisians,â€”that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the
virtues you possess.â€

â€œMy dear vicomte,â€ returned Monte Cristo, â€œI do not see, in all I have
done, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the
pretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for I
knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to
breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival
in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del
Popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.
I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the
hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had
the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when
I came to France. You might some time ago have looked upon this
resolution as a vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and
you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word.â€

â€œI will keep it,â€ returned Morcerf; â€œbut I fear that you will be much
disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic
horizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with
which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our
Chimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount ValÃ©rien, our Great
Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian
well to water the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so
many as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a
policeman than a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a
city, that you will not find in its eighty-five departmentsâ€”I say
eighty-five, because I do not include Corsicaâ€”you will not find, then,
in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a
telegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up
a gaslamp. There is but one service I can render you, and for that I
place myself entirely at your orders, that is, to present, or make my
friends present, you everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to
introduce youâ€”with your name, and your fortune, and your talentâ€ (Monte
Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile) â€œyou can present yourself
everywhere, and be well received. I can be useful in one way onlyâ€”if
knowledge of Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself
comfortable, or of the bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to
find you a fitting dwelling here. I do not dare offer to share my
apartments with you, as I shared yours at Romeâ€”I, who do not profess
egotism, but am yet egotist _par excellence_; for, except myself, these
rooms would not hold a shadow more, unless that shadow were feminine.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the count, â€œthat is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect
that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage. May I
congratulate you?â€

â€œThe affair is still in projection.â€

â€œAnd he who says in â€˜projection,â€™ means already decided,â€ said Debray.

â€œNo,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œmy father is most anxious about it; and I hope,
ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my
betrothedâ€”Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie Danglars.â€

â€œEugÃ©nie Danglars,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œtell me, is not her father
Baron Danglars?â€

â€œYes,â€ returned Morcerf, â€œa baron of a new creation.â€

â€œWhat matter,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œif he has rendered the State services
which merit this distinction?â€

â€œEnormous ones,â€ answered Beauchamp. â€œAlthough in reality a Liberal, he
negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made him
a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the
ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his
button-hole.â€

â€œAh,â€ interrupted Morcerf, laughing, â€œBeauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that
for the _Corsaire_ or the _Charivari_, but spare my future
father-in-law before me.â€ Then, turning to Monte Cristo, â€œYou just now
spoke his name as if you knew the baron?â€

â€œI do not know him,â€ returned Monte Cristo; â€œbut I shall probably soon
make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house
of Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and
Thomson & French at Rome.â€ As he pronounced the two last names, the
count glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger expected to produce
an effect on Morrel, he was not mistakenâ€”Maximilian started as if he
had been electrified.

â€œThomson & French,â€ said he; â€œdo you know this house, monsieur?â€

20253m



â€œThey are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,â€ returned
the count quietly. â€œCan my influence with them be of any service to
you?â€

â€œOh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,
up to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a
great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied
having rendered us this service.â€

â€œI shall be at your orders,â€ said Monte Cristo bowing.

â€œBut,â€ continued Morcerf, â€œ_Ã  propos_ of Danglars,â€”we have strangely
wandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable habitation
for the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some
place. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?â€

â€œFaubourg Saint-Germain,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud. â€œThe count will find
there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.â€

â€œBah! ChÃ¢teau-Renaud,â€ returned Debray, â€œyou only know your dull and
gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him,
countâ€”live in the ChaussÃ©e dâ€™Antin, thatâ€™s the real centre of Paris.â€

â€œBoulevard de lâ€™OpÃ©ra,â€ said Beauchamp; â€œthe second floorâ€”a house with
a balcony. The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought
there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.â€

â€œYou have no idea, then, Morrel?â€ asked ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œyou do not
propose anything.â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ returned the young man, smiling; â€œon the contrary, I have
one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant
proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will
venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the
Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue
Meslay.â€

â€œYou have a sister?â€ asked the count.

â€œYes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.â€

â€œMarried?â€

â€œNearly nine years.â€

â€œHappy?â€ asked the count again.

â€œAs happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,â€ replied
Maximilian. â€œShe married the man she loved, who remained faithful to us
in our fallen fortunesâ€”Emmanuel Herbaut.â€

Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly.

â€œI live there during my leave of absence,â€ continued Maximilian; â€œand I
shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition
of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.â€

â€œOne minute,â€ cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to
reply. â€œTake care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the
Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch
of him.â€

20255m



â€œOh, no,â€ said Morrel; â€œmy sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law
is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the count will be
in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.â€

â€œThanks, monsieur,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œI shall content myself with
being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the
honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these
gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.â€

â€œWhat,â€ cried Morcerf; â€œyou are, then, going to a hotelâ€”that will be
very dull for you.â€

â€œWas I so badly lodged at Rome?â€ said Monte Cristo smiling.

â€œ_Parbleu!_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing
your apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a
similar sum every day.â€

â€œIt is not that which deterred me,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbut as I
determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre,
and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.â€

â€œBut you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?â€ said
Beauchamp.

â€œIt is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and
cannot speak,â€ returned Monte Cristo.

â€œIt is Ali!â€ cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.

â€œYes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.â€

â€œCertainly,â€ said Morcerf; â€œI recollect him perfectly. But how could
you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?â€”he
will do everything wrong.â€

â€œUndeceive yourself, monsieur,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œI am quite sure,
that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows my
tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the
instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for
me. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten oâ€™clock; he was waiting
for me at nine at the BarriÃ¨re de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper;
it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,â€ and Monte
Cristo passed a paper to Albert.

â€œAh, that is really original,â€ said Beauchamp.

â€œAnd very princely,â€ added ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œWhat, do you not know your house?â€ asked Debray.

â€œNo,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œI told you I did not wish to be behind my
time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscountâ€™s
door.â€ The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was
a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such
an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said
was falseâ€”besides, why should he tell a falsehood?

â€œWe must content ourselves, then,â€ said Beauchamp, â€œwith rendering the
count all the little services in our power. I, in my quality of
journalist, open all the theatres to him.â€

â€œThanks, monsieur,â€ returned Monte Cristo, â€œmy steward has orders to
take a box at each theatre.â€

â€œIs your steward also a Nubian?â€ asked Debray.

â€œNo, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of
anyoneâ€™s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.â€

â€œIs it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so
well?â€

â€œYes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been
a soldier, a smugglerâ€”in fact, everything. I would not be quite sure
that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifleâ€”a stab
with a knife, for instance.â€

â€œAnd you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,â€ said
Debray. â€œOf how much does he rob you every year?â€

â€œOn my word,â€ replied the count, â€œnot more than another. I am sure he
answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.â€

â€œThen,â€ continued ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œsince you have an establishment, a
steward, and a hotel in the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, you only want a mistress.â€
Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the countâ€™s
box at the Argentina and Valle theatres.

â€œI have something better than that,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œI have a
slave. You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or
the VariÃ©tÃ©s; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but
I have nothing to fear.â€

â€œBut you forget,â€ replied Debray, laughing, â€œthat we are Franks by name
and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she
puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.â€

â€œWho will tell her?â€

â€œThe first person who sees her.â€

â€œShe only speaks Romaic.â€

â€œThat is different.â€

â€œBut at least we shall see her,â€ said Beauchamp, â€œor do you keep
eunuchs as well as mutes?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œI do not carry brutalism so far.
Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me
will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that
reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.â€

They had long since passed to dessert and cigars.

â€œMy dear Albert,â€ said Debray, rising, â€œit is half-past two. Your guest
is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst
sometimes. I must return to the ministerâ€™s. I will tell him of the
count, and we shall soon know who he is.â€

â€œTake care,â€ returned Albert; â€œno one has been able to accomplish
that.â€

â€œOh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost
always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
thousand francs to spend for this purpose.â€

â€œAnd when you know, will you tell me?â€

â€œI promise you. _Au revoir_, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.â€

As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, â€œMy carriage.â€

â€œBravo,â€ said Beauchamp to Albert; â€œI shall not go to the Chamber, but
I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M.
Danglars.â€

â€œFor heavenâ€™s sake, Beauchamp,â€ returned Morcerf, â€œdo not deprive me of
the merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he not peculiar?â€

â€œHe is more than that,â€ replied ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œhe is one of the most
extraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?â€

â€œDirectly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us
a visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.â€

â€œBe sure I shall not fail to do so,â€ returned the count, bowing.

And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud,
leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.



 Chapter 41. The Presentation

When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, â€œMy dear count,â€
said he, â€œallow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you
a specimen of a bachelorâ€™s apartment. You, who are accustomed to the
palaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square
feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As we
pass from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you
breathe.â€

Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon on the
ground floor. Albert led him first to his _atelier_, which was, as we
have said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all
that Albert had collected hereâ€”old cabinets, Japanese porcelain,
Oriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the
worldâ€”everything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he
recognized their date, their country, and their origin.

Morcerf had expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he
who, under the countâ€™s guidance, followed a course of archÃ¦ology,
mineralogy, and natural history.

They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon.
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were
landscapes by DuprÃ©, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing
oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroixâ€™s Arabian cavaliers, with their
long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their
horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders
contended fiercely with their maces; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger,
representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist
the rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his
flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the
sun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa,
but more poetic; _pastels_ by Giraud and MÃ¼ller, representing children
like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from
the album of Dauzatsâ€™ â€œTravels in the East,â€ that had been made in a
few seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a
mosqueâ€”in a word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as
recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past.

Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the
traveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for
the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named
instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy
to see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style
associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him. From the
salon they passed into the bedchamber; it was a model of taste and
simple elegance. A single portrait, signed by LÃ©opold Robert, shone in
its carved and gilded frame. This portrait attracted the Count of Monte
Cristoâ€™s attention, for he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and
stopped suddenly before it.

It was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, with a
dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long
lashes. She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a
red and black bodice, and golden pins in her hair. She was looking at
the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky. The light
was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that
spread itself over the countâ€™s visage, or the nervous heaving of his
chest and shoulders. Silence prevailed for an instant, during which
Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.

â€œYou have there a most charming mistress, viscount,â€ said the count in
a perfectly calm tone; â€œand this costumeâ€”a ball costume,
doubtlessâ€”becomes her admirably.â€

â€œAh, monsieur,â€ returned Albert, â€œI would never forgive you this
mistake if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my
mother; she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus
six or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and
the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same
as she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the
countâ€™s absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable
surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my
father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the
best works of LÃ©opold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It
is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most
assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a
most mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who
paints exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a
picture, gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to
displease M. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you.
Excuse my talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of
introducing you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any
allusions to this picture. The picture seems to have a malign
influence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and
still more rarely does she look at it without weeping. This
disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the
count and countess, who are still as much united, although married more
than twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.â€

Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning
in his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the
simplicity of his heart.

â€œNow,â€ said Albert, â€œthat you have seen all my treasures, allow me to
offer them to you, unworthy as they are. Consider yourself as in your
own house, and to put yourself still more at your ease, pray accompany
me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I wrote from Rome an
account of the services you rendered me, and to whom I announced your
promised visit, and I may say that both the count and countess
anxiously desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat _blasÃ©_ I
know, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor, who
has seen so many others. However, accept what I propose to you as an
initiation into Parisian lifeâ€”a life of politeness, visiting, and
introductions.â€

Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he accepted the offer
without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of those conventions of
society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty. Albert summoned his
servant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame de Morcerf of the
arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed him with the
count. When they arrived at the antechamber, above the door was visible
a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of
the furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached to this
blazon. Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively.

â€œAzure seven merlets, or, placed bender,â€ said he. â€œThese are,
doubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that
enables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldryâ€”I, a count
of a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery
of St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been
told that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must have
something on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by
the custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you.â€

â€œIt is not indiscreet,â€ returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of
conviction. â€œYou have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that is,
those of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield,
which has gules, a silver tower, which are my motherâ€™s. By her side I
am Spanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have heard, one
of the oldest of the south of France.â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Monte Cristo â€œthese blazons prove that. Almost all the
armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a
cross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of the
long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to
accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the
Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you
mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.â€

â€œIt is possible,â€ said Morcerf; â€œmy father has in his study a
genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made
commentaries that would have greatly edified dâ€™Hozier and Jaucourt. At
present I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are
beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our
popular government.â€

â€œWell, then, your government would do well to choose from the past
something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,
and which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,â€
continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, â€œyou are more fortunate than the
government, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the
imagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that
explains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much
admired on the visage of the noble Catalan.â€

It would have required the penetration of Å’dipus or the Sphinx to have
divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words, apparently
uttered with the greatest politeness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile,
and pushed open the door above which were his arms, and which, as we
have said, opened into the salon. In the most conspicuous part of the
salon was another portrait. It was that of a man, from five to
eight-and-thirty, in the uniform of a general officer, wearing the
double epaulet of heavy bullion, that indicates superior rank, the
ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck, which showed he was a
commander, and on the right breast, the star of a grand officer of the
order of the Saviour, and on the left that of the grand cross of
Charles III., which proved that the person represented by the picture
had served in the wars of Greece and Spain, or, what was just the same
thing as regarded decorations, had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in
the two countries.

Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care
than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he
found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person.

He was a man of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least
fifty, and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with
his almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He
was dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons
of the different orders to which he belonged.

He entered with a tolerably dignified step, and some little haste.
Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step.
It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground, and his eyes on the
Count of Morcerf.

â€œFather,â€ said the young man, â€œI have the honor of presenting to you
the Count of Monte Cristo, the generous friend whom I had the good
fortune to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you.â€

â€œYou are most welcome, monsieur,â€ said the Count of Morcerf, saluting
Monte Cristo with a smile, â€œand monsieur has rendered our house, in
preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal
gratitude.â€

As he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair, while
he seated himself in another opposite the window.

Monte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in
such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet
curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a
whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted
there.

â€œThe countess,â€ said Morcerf, â€œwas at her toilet when she was informed
of the visit she was about to receive. She will, however, be in the
salon in ten minutes.â€

â€œIt is a great honor to me,â€ returned Monte Cristo, â€œto be thus, on the
first day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose
merit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been
equitable, but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja, or in the
mountains of Atlas, a marshalâ€™s staff to offer you?â€

â€œOh,â€ replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, â€œI have left the service,
monsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through the first
campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could, therefore,
expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the
elder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July was, it
seems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it
was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I
tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the
battle-field, you do not know how to manÅ“uvre on the slippery grounds
of the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics.
I have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the
twenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the
time.â€

â€œThese are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,â€
returned Monte Cristo. â€œA gentleman of high birth, possessor of an
ample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure
soldier, step by stepâ€”this is uncommon; then become general, peer of
France, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence
a second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire
than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this,
indeed, is praiseworthy,â€”nay, more, it is sublime.â€

20265m



Albert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see
Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm.

â€œAlas,â€ continued the stranger, doubtless to dispel the slight cloud
that covered Morcerfâ€™s brow, â€œwe do not act thus in Italy; we grow
according to our race and our species, and we pursue the same lines,
and often the same uselessness, all our lives.â€

â€œBut, monsieur,â€ said the Count of Morcerf, â€œfor a man of your merit,
Italy is not a country, and France opens her arms to receive you;
respond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful.
She treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.â€

â€œAh, father,â€ said Albert with a smile, â€œit is evident you do not know
the Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself
with those written on his passport.â€

â€œThat is the most just remark,â€ replied the stranger, â€œI ever heard
made concerning myself.â€

â€œYou have been free to choose your career,â€ observed the Count of
Morcerf, with a sigh; â€œand you have chosen the path strewed with
flowers.â€

â€œPrecisely, monsieur,â€ replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles
that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.

â€œIf I did not fear to fatigue you,â€ said the general, evidently charmed
with the countâ€™s manners, â€œI would have taken you to the Chamber; there
is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern
senators.â€

â€œI shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time,
renew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being
introduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait.â€

â€œAh, here is my mother,â€ cried the viscount.

Monte Cristo, turned round hastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the
entrance of the salon, at the door opposite to that by which her
husband had entered, pale and motionless; when Monte Cristo turned
round, she let fall her arm, which for some unknown reason had been
resting on the gilded door-post. She had been there some moments, and
had heard the last words of the visitor. The latter rose and bowed to
the countess, who inclined herself without speaking.

â€œAh! good heavens, madame,â€ said the count, â€œare you ill, or is it the
heat of the room that affects you?â€

â€œAre you ill, mother?â€ cried the viscount, springing towards her.

She thanked them both with a smile.

â€œNo,â€ returned she, â€œbut I feel some emotion on seeing, for the first
time, the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears
and desolation. Monsieur,â€ continued the countess, advancing with the
majesty of a queen, â€œI owe to you the life of my son, and for this I
bless you. Now, I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus
affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you,
from the bottom of my heart.â€

The count bowed again, but lower than before; he was even paler than
MercÃ©dÃ¨s.

â€œMadame,â€ said he, â€œthe count and yourself recompense too generously a
simple action. To save a man, to spare a fatherâ€™s feelings, or a
motherâ€™s sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed of
humanity.â€

At these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and
politeness, Madame de Morcerf replied:

â€œIt is very fortunate for my son, monsieur, that he found such a
friend, and I thank God that things are thus.â€

And MercÃ©dÃ¨s raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an
expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.
M. de Morcerf approached her.

â€œMadame,â€ said he. â€œI have already made my excuses to the count for
quitting him, and I pray you to do so also. The sitting commences at
two; it is now three, and I am to speak.â€

â€œGo, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your
absence,â€ replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.
â€œMonsieur,â€ continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, â€œwill you do us the
honor of passing the rest of the day with us?â€

â€œBelieve me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I got
out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am
ignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is
but a trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated.â€

â€œWe shall have the pleasure another time,â€ said the countess; â€œyou
promise that?â€

Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but the gesture might
pass for assent.

â€œI will not detain you, monsieur,â€ continued the countess; â€œI would not
have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.â€

â€œMy dear Count,â€ said Albert, â€œI will endeavor to return your
politeness at Rome, and place my coupÃ© at your disposal until your own
be ready.â€

â€œA thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,â€ returned the Count of
Monte Cristo â€œbut I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably employed the
four hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find a
carriage of some sort ready at the door.â€

Albert was used to the countâ€™s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like
Nero, he was in search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him,
but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the countâ€™s orders had
been executed, he accompanied him to the door of the house. Monte
Cristo was not deceived. As soon as he appeared in the Count of
Morcerfâ€™s antechamber, a footman, the same who at Rome had brought the
countâ€™s card to the two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into
the vestibule, and when he arrived at the door the illustrious
traveller found his carriage awaiting him. It was a _coupÃ©_ of Kollerâ€™s
building, and with horses and harness for which Drake had, to the
knowledge of all the lions of Paris, refused on the previous day seven
hundred guineas.

â€œMonsieur,â€ said the count to Albert, â€œI do not ask you to accompany me
to my house, as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry,
and I have, as you know, a reputation to keep up as regards not being
taken by surprise. Give me, therefore, one more day before I invite
you; I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.â€

â€œIf you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not
be a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius at
your control.â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, spread that idea,â€ replied the Count of Monte Cristo,
putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage,
â€œand that will be worth something to me among the ladies.â€

As he spoke, he sprang into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not
so rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost
imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in
which he had left Madame de Morcerf.

When Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir
reclining in a large velvet armchair, the whole room so obscure that
only the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and
the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some
degree of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the
countess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head,
and which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him
as though her voice had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes
of the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and
fragrant odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased
cups on the mantle-piece the countessâ€™s smelling-bottle, taken from its
shagreen case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered:

â€œMy dear mother, have you been ill during my absence?â€

â€œNo, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and
orange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such
violent perfumes.â€

â€œThen, my dear mother,â€ said Albert, putting his hand to the bell,
â€œthey must be taken into the antechamber. You are really ill, and just
now were so pale as you came into the roomâ€”â€”â€

â€œWas I pale, Albert?â€

â€œYes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the
less alarm my father and myself.â€

â€œDid your father speak of it?â€ inquired MercÃ©dÃ¨s eagerly.

â€œNo, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?â€

20269m



â€œYes, I do remember,â€ replied the countess.

A servant entered, summoned by Albertâ€™s ring of the bell.

â€œTake these flowers into the anteroom or dressing-room,â€ said the
viscount; â€œthey make the countess ill.â€

The footman obeyed his orders. A long pause ensued, which lasted until
all the flowers were removed.

â€œWhat is this name of Monte Cristo?â€ inquired the countess, when the
servant had taken away the last vase of flowers, â€œis it a family name,
or the name of the estate, or a simple title?â€

â€œI believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an island
in the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you today, has founded a
commandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of
Florence, Saint George Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order
of Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls
himself a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that
the count is a man of very high distinction.â€

â€œHis manners are admirable,â€ said the countess, â€œat least, as far as I
could judge in the few minutes he remained here.â€

â€œThey are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I
have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities
of Europeâ€”the English, the Spanish, and the German.â€

The countess paused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she
resumed.

â€œYou have seen, my dear Albertâ€”I ask the question as a motherâ€”you have
seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much
knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you
think the count is really what he appears to be?â€

â€œWhat does he appear to be?â€

â€œWhy, you have just said,â€”a man of high distinction.â€

â€œI told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.â€

â€œBut what is your own opinion, Albert?â€

â€œI must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting
him, but I think him a Maltese.â€

â€œI do not ask you of his origin but what he is.â€

â€œAh! what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many
remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I
think, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byronâ€™s
heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some
Lara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient
family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the
force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws
of society.â€

â€œYou sayâ€”â€”â€

â€œI say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the
Mediterranean, without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers
of all nations, and pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not
these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues
for his protection?â€

â€œThat is possible,â€ said the countess, reflecting.

â€œNever mind,â€ continued the young man, â€œsmuggler or not, you must
agree, mother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte
Cristo is a remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the
salons of Paris. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his
_entrÃ©e_ amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement, not
even excepting ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.â€

â€œAnd what do you suppose is the countâ€™s age?â€ inquired MercÃ©dÃ¨s,
evidently attaching great importance to this question.

â€œThirty-five or thirty-six, mother.â€

â€œSo young,â€”it is impossible,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, replying at the same time
to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.

â€œIt is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and
certainly without the slightest premeditation, â€˜at such a period I was
five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,â€™ and I,
induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have
compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this
singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.
Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair,
and his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,â€”he is not only
vigorous, but also young.â€

The countess bent her head, as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter
thoughts.

â€œAnd has this man displayed a friendship for you, Albert?â€ she asked
with a nervous shudder.

â€œI am inclined to think so.â€

â€œAndâ€”doâ€”youâ€”likeâ€”him?â€

â€œWhy, he pleases me in spite of Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay, who tries to convince
me that he is a being returned from the other world.â€

The countess shuddered.

â€œAlbert,â€ she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion, â€œI have
always put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now you are a
man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert, be
prudent.â€

â€œWhy, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice
turn to account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust.
The count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little
sherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at
me, try to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?â€

â€œYou are right,â€ said the countess, â€œand my fears are weakness,
especially when directed against a man who has saved your life. How did
your father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be more
than complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his
business makes him reflective, and he might, without intending itâ€”â€”â€

â€œNothing could be in better taste than my fatherâ€™s demeanor, madame,â€
said Albert; â€œnay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three
compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with
as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each of these
little tickling arrows must have pleased my father,â€ added Albert with
a laugh. â€œAnd thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de
Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers.â€

The countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a reverie that her
eyes gradually closed. The young man, standing up before her, gazed
upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing
with children whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then, after
seeing her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she
had dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door
after him with the utmost precaution.

â€œThis devil of a fellow,â€ he muttered, shaking his head; â€œI said at the
time he would create a sensation here, and I measure his effect by an
infallible thermometer. My mother has noticed him, and he must
therefore, perforce, be remarkable.â€

He went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he
remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a
â€œturnoutâ€ which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of
connoisseurs.

â€œMost decidedly,â€ said he, â€œmen are not equal, and I must beg my father
to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.â€



 Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio

Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six
minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient
to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had
been unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in
order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs
apiece for his horses.

The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to
Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the
Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre,
and masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys,
like two arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive
from the iron gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a
porcelain vase, filled with flowers. This house, isolated from the
rest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu.
Even before the coachman had hailed the _concierge_, the massy gates
rolled on their hingesâ€”they had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as
everywhere else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning. The
coachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening his
speed, and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on
the gravel. The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two
men presented themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who,
smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid
by a mere look from Monte Cristo. The other bowed respectfully, and
offered his arm to assist the count in descending.

â€œThanks, M. Bertuccio,â€ said the count, springing lightly up the three
steps of the portico; â€œand the notary?â€

â€œHe is in the small salon, excellency,â€ returned Bertuccio.

â€œAnd the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number
of the house?â€

â€œYour excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best
engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The
first card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron
Danglars, Rue de la ChaussÃ©e dâ€™Antin, No. 7; the others are on the
mantle-piece of your excellencyâ€™s bedroom.â€

â€œGood; what oâ€™clock is it?â€

â€œFour oâ€™clock.â€

Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman
who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerfâ€™s, and then he
passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the
way.

â€œThese are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,â€ said Monte
Cristo. â€œI trust all this will soon be taken away.â€

Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the
small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyerâ€™s clerk, elevated to the
extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener.

â€œYou are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to
purchase, monsieur?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œYes, count,â€ returned the notary.

â€œIs the deed of sale ready?â€

â€œYes, count.â€

â€œHave you brought it?â€

â€œHere it is.â€

â€œVery well; and where is this house that I purchase?â€ asked the count
carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.
The steward made a gesture that signified, â€œI do not know.â€ The notary
looked at the count with astonishment.

â€œWhat!â€ said he, â€œdoes not the count know where the house he purchases
is situated?â€

â€œNo,â€ returned the count.

â€œThe count does not know?â€

â€œHow should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have
never before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even
set my foot in France.â€

â€œAh, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.â€

At these words Bertuccio turned pale.

â€œAnd where is Auteuil?â€ asked the count.

â€œClose by here, monsieur,â€ replied the notaryâ€”â€œa little beyond Passy; a
charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.â€

â€œSo near as that?â€ said the Count; â€œbut that is not in the country.
What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?â€

â€œI,â€ cried the steward with a strange expression. â€œHis excellency did
not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will
recollectâ€”if he will thinkâ€”â€”â€

â€œAh, true,â€ observed Monte Cristo; â€œI recollect now. I read the
advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title,
â€˜a country house.â€™â€

â€œIt is not yet too late,â€ cried Bertuccio, eagerly; â€œand if your
excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a
better at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ returned Monte Cristo negligently; â€œsince I have this, I will
keep it.â€

â€œAnd you are quite right,â€ said the notary, who feared to lose his fee.
â€œIt is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine
trees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time,
without reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable,
now that old things are so much sought after. I suppose the count has
the tastes of the day?â€

â€œTo be sure,â€ returned Monte Cristo; â€œit is very convenient, then?â€

â€œIt is moreâ€”it is magnificent.â€

â€œ_Peste!_ let us not lose such an opportunity,â€ returned Monte Cristo.
â€œThe deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.â€

And he signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part
of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the
names of the proprietors.

â€œBertuccio,â€ said he, â€œgive fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur.â€

The steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a
bundle of bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never
gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there.

â€œAnd now,â€ demanded the count, â€œare all the forms complied with?â€

â€œAll, sir.â€

â€œHave you the keys?â€

â€œThey are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house,
but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new
possessions.â€

â€œVery well;â€ and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary,
which said, â€œI have no further need of you; you may go.â€

â€œBut,â€ observed the honest notary, â€œthe count is, I think, mistaken; it
is only fifty thousand francs, everything included.â€

â€œAnd your fee?â€

â€œIs included in this sum.â€

â€œBut have you not come from Auteuil here?â€

â€œYes, certainly.â€

â€œWell, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of
time and trouble,â€ said the count; and he made a gesture of polite
dismissal.

The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the ground; it
was the first time he had ever met a similar client.

â€œSee this gentleman out,â€ said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward
followed the notary out of the room.

Scarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book
closed with a lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his
neck, and which never left him. After having sought for a few minutes,
he stopped at a leaf which had several notes, and compared them with
the deed of sale, which lay on the table, and recalling his
_souvenirs_â€”

â€œâ€˜Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;â€™ it is indeed the same,â€ said
he; â€œand now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or
physical terror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!â€
cried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.
â€œBertuccio!â€

The steward appeared at the door.

â€œMonsieur Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œdid you never tell me that you
had travelled in France?â€

â€œIn some parts of Franceâ€”yes, excellency.â€

â€œYou know the environs of Paris, then?â€

â€œNo, excellency, no,â€ returned the steward, with a sort of nervous
trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly
attributed to great disquietude.

â€œIt is unfortunate,â€ returned he, â€œthat you have never visited the
environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you
gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.â€

â€œTo Auteuil!â€ cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became lividâ€”â€œI
go to Auteuil?â€

â€œWell, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you
must come there, as you belong to my service.â€

Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master,
and remained motionless, without making any answer.

â€œWhy, what has happened to you?â€”are you going to make me ring a second
time for the carriage?â€ asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis
XIV. pronounced the famous, â€œI have been almost obliged to wait.â€
Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse
voice:

â€œHis excellencyâ€™s horses!â€

Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the
steward appeared.

â€œYour excellencyâ€™s carriage is at the door,â€ said he.

â€œWell, take your hat and gloves,â€ returned Monte Cristo.

â€œAm I to accompany you, your excellency?â€ cried Bertuccio.

â€œCertainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the
house.â€

20277m



It was unexampled for a servant of the countâ€™s to dare to dispute an
order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his
master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which
he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.



 Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil

Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio
signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of
the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the
carriage, muttered a short prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless
thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewardâ€™s
extraordinary repugnance for the countâ€™s projected drive without the
walls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this
little journey. In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the stewardâ€™s
emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village.
Bertuccio, crouched in the corner of the carriage, began to examine
with a feverish anxiety every house they passed.

â€œTell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28,â€ said the count,
fixing his eyes on the steward, to whom he gave this order.

Bertuccioâ€™s forehead was covered with perspiration; however, he obeyed,
and, leaning out of the window, he cried to the coachman,â€”â€œRue de la
Fontaine, No. 28.â€ No. 28 was situated at the extremity of the village;
during the drive night had set in, and darkness gave the surroundings
the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage. The carriage
stopped, the footman sprang off the box and opened the door.

â€œWell,â€ said the count, â€œyou do not get out, M. Bertuccioâ€”you are going
to stay in the carriage, then? What are you thinking of this evening?â€

Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his shoulder to the count, who, this
time, leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage.

â€œKnock,â€ said the count, â€œand announce me.â€

Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked he.

â€œIt is your new master, my good fellow,â€ said the footman. And he held
out to the concierge the notaryâ€™s order.

â€œThe house is sold, then?â€ demanded the concierge; â€œand this gentleman
is coming to live here?â€

â€œYes, my friend,â€ returned the count; â€œand I will endeavor to give you
no cause to regret your old master.â€

â€œOh, monsieur,â€ said the concierge, â€œI shall not have much cause to
regret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was
here last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him
in anything at all.â€

â€œWhat was the name of your old master?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œThe Marquis of Saint-MÃ©ran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house
for what he gave for it.â€

â€œThe Marquis of Saint-MÃ©ran!â€ returned the count. â€œThe name is not
unknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-MÃ©ran!â€ and he appeared to
meditate.

â€œAn old gentleman,â€ continued the concierge, â€œa staunch follower of the
Bourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had
been the kingâ€™s attorney at NÃ®mes, and afterwards at Versailles.â€

Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall
against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling.

â€œAnd is not this daughter dead?â€ demanded Monte Cristo; â€œI fancy I have
heard so.â€

â€œYes, monsieur, one-and-twenty years ago; and since then we have not
seen the poor marquis three times.â€

â€œThanks, thanks,â€ said Monte Cristo, judging from the stewardâ€™s utter
prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger
of breaking it. â€œGive me a light.â€

â€œShall I accompany you, monsieur?â€

â€œNo, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light.â€

And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold
pieces, which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the
concierge.

â€œAh, monsieur,â€ said he, after having vainly searched on the
mantle-piece and the shelves, â€œI have not got any candles.â€

â€œTake one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œand show
me the apartments.â€

The steward obeyed in silence, but it was easy to see, from the manner
in which the hand that held the light trembled, how much it cost him to
obey. They went over a tolerably large ground floor; a first floor
consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near one of the
bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden.

â€œAh, here is a private staircase,â€ said the count; â€œthat is convenient.
Light me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ replied Bertuccio, â€œit leads to the garden.â€

â€œAnd, pray, how do you know that?â€

â€œIt ought to do so, at least.â€

â€œWell, let us be sure of that.â€

Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to
the garden. At the outer door the steward paused.

â€œGo on, Monsieur Bertuccio,â€ said the count.

But he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned;
his haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some
terrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut
out horrible recollections.

â€œWell!â€ insisted the Count.

â€œNo, no,â€ cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the
interior wall. â€œNo, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.â€

â€œWhat does this mean?â€ demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.

â€œWhy, you must see, your excellency,â€ cried the steward, â€œthat this is
not natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly
at Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be
No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all? I am sure
you would not have forced me to come. I hoped your house would have
been some other one than this; as if there was not another house at
Auteuil than that of the assassination!â€

â€œWhat, what!â€ cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, â€œwhat words do you
utter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you areâ€”always mysteries or
superstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you
are not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?â€

Bertuccio raised the lantern, and obeyed. The door, as it opened,
disclosed a gloomy sky, in which the moon strove vainly to struggle
through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which
she illumined for an instant, only to sink into obscurity. The steward
wished to turn to the left.

â€œNo, no, monsieur,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œWhat is the use of following
the alleys? Here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards.â€

Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he
continued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took
the right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward
could not restrain himself.

â€œMove, monsieurâ€”move away, I entreat you; you are exactly in the spot!â€

â€œWhat spot?â€

â€œWhere he fell.â€

20281m



â€œMy dear Monsieur Bertuccio,â€ said Monte Cristo, laughing, â€œcontrol
yourself; we are not at SartÃ¨ne or at Corte. This is not a Corsican
_maquis_ but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still you must
not calumniate it for that.â€

â€œMonsieur, I implore you do not stay there!â€

â€œI think you are going mad, Bertuccio,â€ said the count coldly. â€œIf that
is the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum.â€

â€œAlas! excellency,â€ returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking
his head in a manner that would have excited the countâ€™s laughter, had
not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him
attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience. â€œAlas!
excellency, the evil has arrived!â€

â€œM. Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œI am very glad to tell you, that while
you gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man
possessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always
observed, that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I
knew you were a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding
over some old history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy,
because in Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France
they are considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy
themselves with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which
avenge.â€

Bertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did
not let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered
countenance. Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at
Rome, he had bent upon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone
that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor stewardâ€”

â€œThe AbbÃ© Busoni, then told me an untruth,â€ said he, â€œwhen, after his
journey in France, in 1829, he sent you to me, with a letter of
recommendation, in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities.
Well, I shall write to the abbÃ©; I shall hold him responsible for his
_protÃ©gÃ©â€™s_ misconduct, and I shall soon know all about this
assassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in a country, I
conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself within the
compass of the French laws for your sake.â€

â€œOh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,â€
cried Bertuccio, in despair. â€œI have always been an honest man, and, as
far as lay in my power, I have done good.â€

â€œI do not deny it,â€ returned the count; â€œbut why are you thus agitated.
It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in
the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.â€

â€œBut, your excellency,â€ replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, â€œdid not the
AbbÃ© Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at NÃ®mes, tell you
that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?â€

â€œYes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded
you had stolenâ€”that was all.â€

â€œOh, your excellency!â€ returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.

â€œOr, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the
desire of making a â€˜stiff,â€™ as you call it.â€

â€œYes, my good master,â€ cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the countâ€™s
feet, â€œit was simply vengeanceâ€”nothing else.â€

â€œI understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes
you in this manner.â€

â€œBut, monsieur, it is very natural,â€ returned Bertuccio, â€œsince it was
in this house that my vengeance was accomplished.â€

â€œWhat! my house?â€

â€œOh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.â€

â€œWhose, then? The Marquis de Saint-MÃ©ran, I think, the concierge said.
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€

â€œOh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.â€

â€œThis is strange,â€ returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his
reflections, â€œthat you should find yourself without any preparation in
a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ said the steward, â€œit is fatality, I am sure. First, you
purchase a house at Auteuilâ€”this house is the one where I have
committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same
staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received
the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just
buried his child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too
much like Providence.â€

â€œWell, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is Providence. I always
suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede
something to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.â€

â€œI have related it but once, and that was to the AbbÃ© Busoni. Such
things,â€ continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, â€œare only related under
the seal of confession.â€

â€œThen,â€ said the count, â€œI refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux
or Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like
anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my
servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I
confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of
police, for, in Italy, justice is only paid when silentâ€”in France she
is paid only when she speaks. _Peste!_ I thought you somewhat Corsican,
a great deal smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have
other strings to your bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur
Bertuccio.â€

â€œOh, your excellency, your excellency!â€ cried the steward, struck with
terror at this threat, â€œif that is the only reason I cannot remain in
your service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go
to the scaffold.â€

â€œThat is different,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbut if you intend to tell
an untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.â€

â€œNo, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell
you all, for the AbbÃ© Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret;
but, I pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just
bursting through the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and
wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de
Villefort.â€

â€œWhat!â€ cried Monte Cristo, â€œit was M. de Villefort?â€

â€œYour excellency knows him?â€

â€œThe former royal attorney at NÃ®mes?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWho married the Marquis of Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s daughter?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWho enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright,
the most rigid magistrate on the bench?â€

â€œWell, monsieur,â€ said Bertuccio, â€œthis man with this spotless
reputationâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWas a villain.â€

â€œBah,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œimpossible!â€

â€œIt is as I tell you.â€

â€œAh, really,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œHave you proof of this?â€

â€œI had it.â€

â€œAnd you have lost it; how stupid!â€

â€œYes; but by careful search it might be recovered.â€

â€œReally,â€ returned the count, â€œrelate it to me, for it begins to
interest me.â€

And the count, humming an air from _Lucia_, went to sit down on a
bench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts. Bertuccio
remained standing before him.

20285m




 Chapter 44. The Vendetta

At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?â€ asked
Bertuccio.

â€œWhere you please,â€ returned Monte Cristo, â€œsince I know nothing at all
of it.â€

â€œI thought the AbbÃ© Busoni had told your excellency.â€

â€œSome particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and
I have forgotten them.â€

â€œThen I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.â€

â€œGo on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.â€

â€œThe story begins in 1815.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œ1815 is not yesterday.â€

â€œNo, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had
happened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the
service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed
entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became
orphansâ€”I at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been
his son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the
Island of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly
wounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.â€

â€œBut that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,â€ said the
count; â€œunless I am mistaken, it has been already written.â€

â€œExcuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you
promised to be patient.â€

â€œGo on; I will keep my word.â€

â€œOne day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the
little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cap Corse. This letter
was from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that
he should return by ChÃ¢teauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and NÃ®mes;
and, if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at NÃ®mes,
with an innkeeper with whom I had dealings.â€

â€œIn the smuggling line?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œEh, your excellency? Everyone must live.â€

â€œCertainly; go on.â€

â€œI loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved
not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a
thousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law,
and with the other five hundred I set off for NÃ®mes. It was easy to do
so, and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything
favored my project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind
became contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able
to enter the RhÃ´ne. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to
Arles. I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the
road to NÃ®mes.â€

â€œWe are getting to the story now?â€

â€œYes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you
what is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres
took place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,
Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they
suspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres,
your excellency?â€

â€œVaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.â€

â€œAs I entered NÃ®mes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you
encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered,
and burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became
terrified, not for myselfâ€”for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had
nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us
smugglersâ€”but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from
the army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was
everything to apprehend. I hastened to the innkeeper. My misgivings had
been but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at
NÃ®mes, and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand
hospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to
discover the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much
were they dreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had
heard so much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the kingâ€™s
attorney.â€

â€œAnd this kingâ€™s attorney was named Villefort?â€ asked Monte Cristo
carelessly.

â€œYes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been
deputy procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was
said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the
departure from the Island of Elba.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œyou went to him?â€

â€œâ€˜Monsieur,â€™ I said, â€˜my brother was assassinated yesterday in the
streets of NÃ®mes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.
You are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to
avenge those she has been unable to protect.â€™

â€œâ€˜Who was your brother?â€™ asked he.

â€œâ€˜A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.â€™

â€œâ€˜A soldier of the usurper, then?â€™

â€œâ€˜A soldier of the French army.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ replied he, â€˜he has smitten with the sword, and he has
perished by the sword.â€™

â€œâ€˜You are mistaken, monsieur,â€™ I replied; â€˜he has perished by the
poniard.â€™

â€œâ€˜What do you want me to do?â€™ asked the magistrate.

â€œâ€˜I have already told youâ€”avenge him.â€™

â€œâ€˜On whom?â€™

â€œâ€˜On his murderers.â€™

â€œâ€˜How should I know who they are?â€™

â€œâ€˜Order them to be sought for.â€™

â€œâ€˜Why, your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a
duel. All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in
the time of the emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people
here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct.â€™

â€œâ€˜Monsieur,â€™ I replied, â€˜it is not for myself that I entreat your
interferenceâ€”I should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother
had a wife, and were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would
perish from want, for my brotherâ€™s pay alone kept her. Pray, try and
obtain a small government pension for her.â€™

â€œâ€˜Every revolution has its catastrophes,â€™ returned M. de Villefort;
â€˜your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and
government owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the
vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans
of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother
would be today, in all probability, condemned to death. What has
happened is quite natural, and in conformity with the law of
reprisals.â€™

â€œâ€˜What,â€™ cried I, â€˜do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?â€™

â€œâ€˜All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,â€™ replied M. de Villefort;
â€˜they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken
the time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too late
now. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.â€™

â€œI looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from
further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said
in a low voice, â€˜Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know
that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed to
kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.
Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,
that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against
you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet
your last hour has come.â€™ And before he had recovered from his
surprise, I opened the door and left the room.â€

â€œWell, well,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œsuch an innocent looking person as
you are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a kingâ€™s attorney at
that! But did he know what was meant by the terrible word â€˜vendettaâ€™?â€

â€œHe knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,
and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I
was so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became
alarmed, and dared not stay any longer at NÃ®mes, so he solicited a
change of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was
nominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to
avenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it
went, was never above half a dayâ€™s journey before me, who followed him
on foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him onlyâ€”for I had
an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesâ€”but to kill him without
being discoveredâ€”at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged
to myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.

â€œFor three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took
not a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I
discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him
thither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead
of entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on
horseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little
inn, and entered by the gate you see there.â€

Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in
the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded.

â€œAs I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and
gained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was
evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged,
as the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-MÃ©ran,
Villefortâ€™s father-in-law. M. de Saint-MÃ©ran lived at Marseilles, so
that this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be
let to a young widow, known only by the name of â€˜the Baroness.â€™

â€œOne evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and
handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not
overlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de
Villefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her
features, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair.
As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,
I saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the
little door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to
meet him. They threw themselves into each otherâ€™s arms, embraced
tenderly, and returned together to the house. The man was M. de
Villefort; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would
be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone.â€

20291m



â€œAnd,â€ asked the count, â€œdid you ever know the name of this woman?â€

â€œNo, excellency,â€ returned Bertuccio; â€œyou will see that I had no time
to learn it.â€

â€œGo on.â€

â€œThat evening,â€ continued Bertuccio, â€œI could have killed the
procureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the
neighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if
his cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the
next occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a
chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden.
Three days after, about seven oâ€™clock in the evening, I saw a servant
on horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to
SÃ¨vres. I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not
deceived. Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his
errand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot,
muffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he
closed after him. I descended rapidly; although I had not seen
Villefortâ€™s face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart. I
crossed the street, and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the
wall, and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden.

â€œThis time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife
out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the
wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it,
taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock. Nothing,
then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds. The
garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the
middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy
foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers. In order to
go from the door to the house, or from the house to the door, M. de
Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees.

20293m



â€œIt was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint
glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds
that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led
to the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick
shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of
discovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must
take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I
fancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your
excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies
that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours
passed thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight
struck. As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through
the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended.
The door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared.

â€œThe terrible moment had come, but I had so long been prepared for it
that my heart did not fail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket
again, opened it, and made ready to strike. The man in the mantle
advanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in
his hand. I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure. When he
was only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon
was only a spade. I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de
Villefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the
thicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the
earth. I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle,
which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely. Then, I
confess, curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort
was going to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath.
Then an idea crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the
procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or
eight inches deep. I let him place the box in the hole he had made,
then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his
occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast,
exclaiming:

â€œâ€˜I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my brotherâ€™s; thy treasure for
his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had
hoped.â€™

â€œI know not if he heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell
without a cry. I felt his blood gush over my face, but I was
intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood refreshed, instead of
burning me. In a second I had disinterred the box; then, that it might
not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole, threw the spade over
the wall, and rushed through the door, which I double-locked, carrying
off the key.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œit seems to me this was nothing but murder and
robbery.â€

â€œNo, your excellency,â€ returned Bertuccio; â€œit was a vendetta followed
by restitution.â€

â€œAnd was the sum a large one?â€

â€œIt was not money.â€

â€œAh, I recollect,â€ replied the count; â€œdid you not say something of an
infant?â€

â€œYes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and
with my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth
was wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored
hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not
yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart,
and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a
doctor would have doneâ€”I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them,
and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and
cried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy.

â€œâ€˜God has not cursed me then,â€™ I cried, â€˜since he permits me to save
the life of a human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken
away.â€™â€

20295m



â€œAnd what did you do with the child?â€ asked Monte Cristo. â€œIt was an
embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.â€

â€œI had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at
Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I
passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the
road, and I inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my
statement, the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy
parents, the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from
the child as well as from anyone else. No objection was raised, but
they pointed out the asylum, which was situated at the upper end of the
Rue dâ€™Enfer, and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen
in two pieces, so that one of the two letters which marked it was on
the piece wrapped around the child, while the other remained in my
possession, I rang the bell, and fled with all speed. A fortnight after
I was at Rogliano, and I said to Assunta:

â€œâ€˜Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.â€™

â€œShe demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,â€”â€˜Giovanni,â€™
said she, â€˜you should have brought this child with you; we would have
replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then,
in consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.â€™ In
reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim
him if we became rich.â€

â€œWhat letters were marked on the linen?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œAn H and an N, surmounted by a baronâ€™s coronet.â€

â€œBy heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you
study heraldry?â€

â€œIn your service, excellency, where everything is learned.â€

â€œGo on, I am curious to know two things.â€

â€œWhat are they, your excellency?â€

â€œWhat became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy,
M. Bertuccio.â€

â€œNo excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.â€

â€œI thought you did; I must have been mistaken.â€

â€œNo, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your
excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?â€

â€œThe second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for
a confessor, and the AbbÃ© Busoni came to visit you at your request in
the prison at NÃ®mes.â€

â€œThe story will be very long, excellency.â€

â€œWhat matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose
you are very much inclined for it either.â€ Bertuccio bowed, and resumed
his story.

â€œPartly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly
to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade
of smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the
laws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were
ill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were
perpetually breaking out in Avignon, NÃ®mes, or UzÃ¨s. We profited by
this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere.
Since my brotherâ€™s assassination in the streets of NÃ®mes, I had never
entered the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were
connected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to
come to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from
Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus,
at Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our
goods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the
gendarmes and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade,
when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for
myself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing
the gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the
judges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into
the past. And in my past life they might find something far more grave
than the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a
permit. So, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most
astonishing deeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too
great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of
those projects which require rapid decision, and vigorous and
determined execution. In reality, when you have once devoted your life
to your enterprises, you are no longer the equal of other men, or,
rather, other men are no longer your equals, and whosoever has taken
this resolution, feels his strength and resources doubled.â€

â€œPhilosophy, M. Bertuccio,â€ interrupted the count; â€œyou have done a
little of everything in your life.â€

â€œOh, excellency!â€

â€œNo, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet
I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which
is more than can be said for all philosophy.â€

â€œMy journeys became more and more extensive and more productive.
Assunta took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as
I was setting off on an expedition, â€˜Go,â€™ said she; â€˜at your return I
will give you a surprise.â€™ I questioned her, but in vain; she would
tell me nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six
weeks; we had been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English
cottons, and we ran our cargo without opposition, and returned home
full of joy. When I entered the house, the first thing I beheld in the
middle of Assuntaâ€™s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous
compared with the rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or
eight months old. I uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I
had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the
recollection that I had abandoned this child. For the assassination
itself I had never felt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She
had profited by my absence, and furnished with the half of the linen,
and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the
child at the asylum, had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No
objection was raised, and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I
confess, your excellency, when I saw this poor creature sleeping
peacefully in its cradle, I felt my eyes filled with tears. â€˜Ah,
Assunta,â€™ cried I, â€˜you are an excellent woman, and Heaven will bless
you.â€™â€

â€œThis,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œis less correct than your philosophy,â€”it is
only faith.â€

â€œAlas, your excellency is right,â€ replied Bertuccio, â€œand God made this
infant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature
declare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault
in his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes,
of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion;
only his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular
expression, and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of
his smile.

â€œUnfortunately, there is a proverb which says that â€˜red is either
altogether good or altogether bad.â€™ The proverb was but too correct as
regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst
disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother
encouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the
town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the
most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese
preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighborâ€™s orchard, or the dried
apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples
that grew in my garden.

â€œOne day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor Wasilio,
who, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his purse
or his valuablesâ€”for, as your excellency knows, there are no thieves in
Corsicaâ€”complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we
thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but he
persisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day, Benedetto, who had
been gone from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not
return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he
said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For more than a month
past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish for, had taken
it into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had passed by
Rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks had
greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.
â€˜Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,â€™ said I; â€˜confess
how you obtained this animal.â€™ Benedetto maintained the truth of what
he had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his
imagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I
threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. â€˜You cannot
beat me,â€™ said he; â€˜you have no right, for you are not my father.â€™

20299m



â€œWe never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so
carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the
childâ€™s whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and
my arm fell without touching him.

â€œThe boy triumphed, and this victory rendered him so audacious, that
all the money of Assunta, whose affection for him seemed to increase as
he became more unworthy of it, was spent in caprices she knew not how
to contend against, and follies she had not the courage to prevent.
When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly, but no sooner was
my back turned than Benedetto became master, and everything went ill.
When he was only eleven, he chose his companions from among the young
men of eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia, or, indeed,
in Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks, been
several times threatened with a prosecution. I became alarmed, as any
prosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was
compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition;
I reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some
impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.

â€œI hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the
severe discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his
character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt. I spoke to
Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me, endeavoring to
tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of
a child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had finished,
burst out laughing.

â€œâ€˜Are you mad, uncle?â€™ (he called me by this name when he was in good
humor); â€˜do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your
mode of existenceâ€”my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious
toil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and
the scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you
are perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum?
Why, I have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me
when I ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your
offer.â€™

â€œThe arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto
rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to
them as a fool.â€

â€œSweet child,â€ murmured Monte Cristo.

â€œOh, had he been my own son,â€ replied Bertuccio, â€œor even my nephew, I
would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that
you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was
striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me
to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the
unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several
times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place
in which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was
already made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for
when the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a
week. My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and
without letting him know anything of my plan, to convey him some
morning on board; by this means his future treatment would depend upon
his own conduct. I set off for France, after having fixed upon the
plan. Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a
difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829. The most
perfect tranquillity was restored, and the vigilance of the
custom-house officers was redoubled, and their strictness was increased
at this time, in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire.

20301m



â€œOur expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our
vesselâ€”which had a double hold, where our goods were concealedâ€”amidst a
number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the RhÃ´ne from
Beaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in
the night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper
with whom we were connected.

â€œWhether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I
know not; but one evening, about five oâ€™clock, our little cabin-boy
came breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of
custom-house officers advancing in our direction. It was not their
proximity that alarmed us, for detachments were constantly patrolling
along the banks of the RhÃ´ne, but the care, according to the boyâ€™s
account, that they took to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on
the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst
the custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as
terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of
any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the
river, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a
ditch that had recently been made from the RhÃ´ne to the canal that runs
from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along
the ditch without being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had
designedly taken this direction. I have already told your excellency of
an innkeeper from NÃ®mes who had set up a little tavern on the road from
Bellegarde to Beaucaire.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œI perfectly recollect him; I think he was
your colleague.â€

â€œPrecisely,â€ answered Bertuccio; â€œbut he had, seven or eight years
before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,
who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his
fortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the
new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I
intended to ask shelter.â€

â€œWhat was his name?â€ inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat
interested in Bertuccioâ€™s story.

â€œGaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of
Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her
village. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by
inches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or
five-and-forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample
proof of his presence of mind and courage.â€

â€œAnd you say,â€ interrupted Monte Cristo â€œthat this took place towards
the yearâ€”â€”â€

â€œ1829, your excellency.â€

â€œIn what month?â€

â€œJune.â€

â€œThe beginning or the end?â€

â€œThe evening of the 3rd.â€

20303m



â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œthe evening of the 3rd of June, 1829. Go on.â€

â€œIt was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we
never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to
break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept
amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might
have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed
the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in
which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity
of announcing our presence.

â€œMy intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with my
presence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted,
and profit by the threatened storm to return to the RhÃ´ne, and
ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. I stepped into the
shed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse
entered with a stranger.

â€œI waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I
could do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often
before. The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the
South of France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell
jewellery at the Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair
lasts, and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and
customers from all parts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount
of 100,000 to 150,000 francs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing
that the room was, as usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he
called to his wife, â€˜Hello, Carconte,â€™ said he, â€˜the worthy priest has
not deceived us; the diamond is real.â€™

â€œAn exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase creaked beneath a
feeble step. â€˜What do you say?â€™ asked his wife, pale as death.

â€œâ€˜I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the
first jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000 francs for it. Only, in
order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to
relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which
the diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit
down, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.â€™

â€œThe jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the
apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond
that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince.

â€œâ€˜Relate your story, madame,â€™ said he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by
the absence of the husband, so that the latter could not influence the
wifeâ€™s story, to see if the two recitals tallied.

â€œâ€˜Oh,â€™ returned she, â€˜it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great
friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond DantÃ¨s. This poor
fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at
his death he bequeathed this diamond to him.â€™

â€œâ€˜But how did he obtain it?â€™ asked the jeweller; â€˜had he it before he
was imprisoned?â€™

â€œâ€˜No, monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance
of a rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and DantÃ¨s took
the same care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman,
when he was set free, gave this stone to DantÃ¨s, who, less fortunate,
died, and, in his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abbÃ©,
who was here this morning, to deliver it.â€™

â€œâ€˜The same story,â€™ muttered the jeweller; â€˜and improbable as it seemed
at first, it may be true. Thereâ€™s only the price we are not agreed
about.â€™

â€œâ€˜How not agreed about?â€™ said Caderousse. â€˜I thought we agreed for the
price I asked.â€™

â€œâ€˜That is,â€™ replied the jeweller, â€˜I offered 40,000 francs.â€™

â€˜Forty thousand,â€™ cried La Carconte; â€˜we will not part with it for that
sum. The abbÃ© told us it was worth 50,000 without the setting.â€™

â€œâ€˜What was the abbÃ©â€™s name?â€™ asked the indefatigable questioner.

â€œâ€˜The AbbÃ© Busoni,â€™ said La Carconte.

â€œâ€˜He was a foreigner?â€™

â€œâ€˜An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.â€™

â€œâ€˜Let me see this diamond again,â€™ replied the jeweller; â€˜the first time
you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.â€™

â€œCaderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen,
opened, and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight of the diamond, which
was as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconteâ€™s eyes sparkled with
cupidity.â€

â€œAnd what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?â€ said Monte
Cristo; â€œdid you credit it?â€

â€œYes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I
thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.â€

â€œThat did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.
Bertuccio. Had you known this Edmond DantÃ¨s, of whom they spoke?â€

â€œNo, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but
once afterwards, and that was from the AbbÃ© Busoni himself, when I saw
him in the prison at NÃ®mes.â€

â€œGo on.â€

â€œThe jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of
steel pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of
its setting, and weighed it carefully.

â€œâ€˜I will give you 45,000,â€™ said he, â€˜but not a sou more; besides, as
that is the exact value of the stone, I brought just that sum with me.â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, thatâ€™s no matter,â€™ replied Caderousse, â€˜I will go back with you
to fetch the other 5,000 francs.â€™

â€œâ€˜No,â€™ returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to
Caderousse, â€˜no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much,
for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However, I will
not go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.â€™

â€œâ€˜At least, replace the diamond in the ring,â€™ said La Carconte sharply.

â€œâ€˜Ah, true,â€™ replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.

â€œâ€˜No matter,â€™ observed Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket,
â€˜someone else will purchase it.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ continued the jeweller; â€˜but someone else will not be so easy
as I am, or content himself with the same story. It is not natural that
a man like you should possess such a diamond. He will inform against
you. You will have to find the AbbÃ© Busoni; and abbÃ©s who give diamonds
worth two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it, and put you
in prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at
liberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs,
will be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000
francs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in
purchasing.â€™

â€œCaderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.

â€œâ€˜No,â€™ said Caderousse, â€˜we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.â€™

â€œâ€˜As you please, my dear sir,â€™ said the jeweller; â€˜I had, however, as
you see, brought you the money in bright coin.â€™ And he drew from his
pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes
of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.

â€œThere was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it
was plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over
in his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous
sum which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife.

â€œâ€˜What do you think of this?â€™ he asked in a low voice.

â€œâ€˜Let him have itâ€”let him have it,â€™ she said. â€˜If he returns to
Beaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he
says, who knows if we shall ever again see the AbbÃ© Busoni?â€”in all
probability we shall never see him.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well, then, so I will!â€™ said Caderousse; â€˜so you may have the diamond
for 45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of
silver buckles.â€™

â€œThe jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box, which contained
several samples of the articles demanded. â€˜Here,â€™ he said, â€˜I am very
straightforward in my dealingsâ€”take your choice.â€™

â€œThe woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the
husband a pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.

â€œâ€˜I hope you will not complain now?â€™ said the jeweller.

â€œâ€˜The abbÃ© told me it was worth 50,000 francs,â€™ muttered Caderousse.

â€œâ€˜Come, comeâ€”give it to me! What a strange fellow you are,â€™ said the
jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. â€˜I give you 45,000
francsâ€”that is, 2,500 livres of income,â€”a fortune such as I wish I had
myself, and you are not satisfied!â€™

â€œâ€˜And the five-and-forty thousand francs,â€™ inquired Caderousse in a
hoarse voice, â€˜where are they? Comeâ€”let us see them.â€™

â€œâ€˜Here they are,â€™ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the
table 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.

â€œâ€˜Wait while I light the lamp,â€™ said La Carconte; â€˜it is growing dark,
and there may be some mistake.â€™ In fact, night had come on during this
conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for
the last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was
apparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte,
absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt;
a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all
these bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it
always happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot.
Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then
handed them to his wife, who counted and counted them again in her
turn. During this time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle
in the lamplight, and the gem threw out jets of light which made him
unmindful of those whichâ€”precursors of the stormâ€”began to play in at
the windows.

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ inquired the jeweller, â€˜is the cash all right?â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ said Caderousse. â€˜Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and
find a bag somewhere.â€™

â€œLa Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern
pocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters,
and put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or
three crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the
entire fortune of the miserable couple.

â€œâ€˜There,â€™ said Caderousse; â€˜and now, although you have wronged us of
perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have your supper with us? I invite you
with good-will.â€™

â€œâ€˜Thank you,â€™ replied the jeweller, â€˜it must be getting late, and I
must return to Beaucaireâ€”my wife will be getting uneasy.â€™ He drew out
his watch, and exclaimed, â€˜_Morbleu!_ nearly nine oâ€™clockâ€”why, I shall
not get back to Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If
the AbbÃ© Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.â€™

â€œâ€˜In another week you will have left Beaucaire,â€™ remarked Caderousse,
â€˜for the fair ends in a few days.â€™

â€œâ€˜True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to M.
Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the
journey on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.â€™

â€œAt this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by
a flash of lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the
lamp.

20307m



â€œâ€˜See here,â€™ exclaimed Caderousse. â€˜You cannot think of going out in
such weather as this.â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,â€™ said the jeweller.

â€œâ€˜And then there are robbers,â€™ said La Carconte. â€˜The road is never
very safe during fair time.â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, as to the robbers,â€™ said Joannes, â€˜here is something for them,â€™
and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the
muzzle. â€˜Here,â€™ said he, â€˜are dogs who bark and bite at the same time,
they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond,
Friend Caderousse.â€™

â€œCaderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed
as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible
thought. â€˜Well, then, a good journey to you,â€™ said Caderousse.

â€œâ€˜Thanks,â€™ replied the jeweller. He then took his cane, which he had
placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment when he
opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly
extinguished. â€˜Oh,â€™ said he, â€˜this is very nice weather, and two
leagues to go in such a storm.â€™

â€œâ€˜Remain,â€™ said Caderousse. â€˜You can sleep here.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes; do stay,â€™ added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; â€˜we will take
every care of you.â€™

â€œâ€˜No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So, once more, good-night.â€™ Caderousse
followed him slowly to the threshold. â€˜I can see neither heaven nor
earth,â€™ said the jeweller, who was outside the door. â€˜Do I turn to the
right, or to the left hand?â€™

â€œâ€˜To the right,â€™ said Caderousse. â€˜You cannot go wrongâ€”the road is
bordered by trees on both sides.â€™

â€œâ€˜Goodâ€”all right,â€™ said a voice almost lost in the distance.

â€œâ€˜Close the door,â€™ said La Carconte; â€˜I do not like open doors when it
thunders.â€™

â€œâ€˜Particularly when there is money in the house, eh?â€™ answered
Caderousse, double-locking the door.

20311m



â€œHe came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and
pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold
and bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the
flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman,
especially, was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was
intensified, her countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled
burning coals.

â€œâ€˜Why,â€™ she inquired in a hoarse voice, â€˜did you invite him to sleep
here tonight?â€™

â€œâ€˜Why?â€™ said Caderousse with a shudder; â€˜why, that he might not have
the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.â€™

â€œâ€˜Ah,â€™ responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe;
â€˜I thought it was for something else.â€™

â€œâ€˜Woman, womanâ€”why do you have such ideas?â€™ cried Caderousse; â€˜or, if
you have them, why donâ€™t you keep them to yourself?â€™

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said La Carconte, after a momentâ€™s pause, â€˜you are not a man.â€™

â€œâ€˜What do you mean?â€™ added Caderousse.

â€œâ€˜If you had been a man, you would not have let him go from here.â€™

â€œâ€˜Woman!â€™

â€œâ€˜Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire.â€™

â€œâ€˜Woman!â€™

â€œâ€˜The road takes a turnâ€”he is obliged to follow itâ€”while alongside of
the canal there is a shorter road.â€™

â€œâ€˜Woman!â€”you offend the good God. Thereâ€”listen!â€™

And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the
livid lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in
the distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode.
â€˜Mercy!â€™ said Caderousse, crossing himself.

20312m



â€œAt the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which
usually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.
Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other.

â€œâ€˜Whoâ€™s there?â€™ cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the
gold and notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his
two hands.

â€œâ€˜It is I,â€™ shouted a voice.

â€œâ€˜And who are you?â€™

â€œâ€˜Eh, _pardieu!_ Joannes, the jeweller.â€™

â€œâ€˜Well, and you said I offended the good God,â€™ said La Carconte with a
horrid smile. â€˜Why, the good God sends him back again.â€™ Caderousse sank
pale and breathless into his chair.

â€œLa Carconte, on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards
the door, opened it, saying, as she did so:

â€œâ€˜Come in, dear M. Joannes.â€™

â€œâ€˜_Ma foi_,â€™ said the jeweller, drenched with rain, â€˜I am not destined
to return to Beaucaire tonight. The shortest follies are best, my dear
Caderousse. You offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have
returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.â€™

â€œCaderousse stammered out something, while he wiped away the sweat that
started to his brow. La Carconte double-locked the door behind the
jeweller.â€



 Chapter 45. The Rain of Blood

As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a
scrutinizing glanceâ€”but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it
did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.
Caderousseâ€™s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La
Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance
of their guest.

â€œâ€˜Well, well,â€™ said the jeweller, â€˜you seem, my good friends, to have
had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting it
over so carefully directly I was gone.â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, no,â€™ answered Caderousse, â€˜that was not my reason, I can assure
you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this
wealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good
fortune, and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches
before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is
not a dream.â€™

â€œThe jeweller smiled. â€˜Have you any other guests in your house?â€™
inquired he.

â€œâ€˜Nobody but ourselves,â€™ replied Caderousse; â€˜the fact is, we do not
lodge travellersâ€”indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody
would think of stopping here.â€™

â€œâ€˜Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.â€™

â€œâ€˜Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,â€™ said La Carconte in her
most gracious manner. â€˜Not at all, I assure you.â€™

â€œâ€˜But where will you manage to stow me?â€™

â€œâ€˜In the chamber overhead.â€™

â€œâ€˜Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?â€™

â€œâ€˜Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.â€™

â€œCaderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment.

â€œThe jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his
supper, by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on
it the slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or
four fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his
treasureâ€”the banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put
back into the bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He
then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from
time to time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his
wet clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to
enable the whole of his garments to be dried.

â€œâ€˜There,â€™ said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the
table, â€˜supper is ready whenever you are.â€™

â€œâ€˜And you?â€™ asked Joannes.

â€œâ€˜I donâ€™t want any supper,â€™ said Caderousse.

â€œâ€˜We dined so very late,â€™ hastily interposed La Carconte.

â€œâ€˜Then it seems I am to eat alone,â€™ remarked the jeweller.

â€œâ€˜Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,â€™ answered La
Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest
even to guests who paid for what they took.

â€œFrom time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.

â€œâ€˜There, there,â€™ said La Carconte; â€˜do you hear that? upon my word, you
did well to come back.â€™

â€œâ€˜Nevertheless,â€™ replied the jeweller, â€˜if by the time I have finished
my supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.â€™

â€œâ€˜Itâ€™s the mistral,â€™ said Caderousse, â€˜and it will be sure to last till
tomorrow morning.â€™ He sighed heavily.

â€œâ€˜Well,â€™ said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, â€˜all I can
say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ chimed in La Carconte, â€˜they will have a wretched night of it.â€™

â€œThe jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was
ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was
suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had
the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously
acquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited
suspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him.
Caderousse, meanwhile, continued to pace the room in gloomy silence,
sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger
had completed his repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the
door and opened it.

â€œâ€˜I believe the storm is over,â€™ said he.

â€œBut as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap
of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a
sudden gust of wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held
in his hand.

â€œTrembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and
returned to his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the
smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth.

â€œâ€˜You must be tired,â€™ said she to the jeweller; â€˜I have spread a pair
of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready, and sleep well.â€™

â€œJoannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in
its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,
instead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder
momentarily increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed
inevitable, he bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He
passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his
footsteps. The quick, eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he
ascended, while Caderousse, on the contrary, turned his back, and
seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him.

â€œAll these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as
they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the
exception of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air
of improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and
fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I
determined to obtain a few hoursâ€™ sleep. Overhead I could accurately
distinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best
arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw
himself on his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his
weight.

â€œInsensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having
no suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked
into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a
long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places
are frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me,
so that I could not see the expression of his countenanceâ€”neither
should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his
head was buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on
him for some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat
immediately opposite to him.

â€œAt this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the
kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed
over the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband,
but as he made no sign of changing his position, she extended her hard,
bony hand, and touched him on the forehead.

20317m



â€œCaderousse shuddered. The womanâ€™s lips seemed to move, as though she
were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my
senses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered.
Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I
fell into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this
unconscious state I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report
of a pistol, followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps
resounded across the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull,
heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet
fully recovered consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with
half-stifled cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A
cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans
effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself
on one arm, I looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as
if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room
above, for some kind of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon
my forehead, and when I passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it
was wet and clammy.

â€œTo the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
perfect silenceâ€”unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about
in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room
below, approached the fire and lit a candle.

â€œThe man was Caderousseâ€”he was pale and his shirt was all bloody.
Having obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I
heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps.

â€œA moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small
shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the
diamond,â€”seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,
then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he
deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round
his head.

â€œAfter this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had
put there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the
other into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of
linen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the
night.

â€œThen all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself with
what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I
fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the
unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his
relief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I
had committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For
this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an
entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room.
The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my
efforts, and I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the
lighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was
lying quite across the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I
had heard had doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully
lacerated her throat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as
the mouth, the blood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I
strode past her, and ascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented
an appearance of the wildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked
over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets,
to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged
across the room. The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning
against the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth
from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in
which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle.

â€œI stumbled over some object; I stooped to examineâ€”it was the second
pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I
approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my
footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them
on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though
trying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.

â€œThis appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I
could no longer be of service to anyone in the house, my only desire
was to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and
uttering a groan of horror.

â€œUpon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house
officers, and two or three gendarmesâ€”all heavily armed. They threw
themselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my
senses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped
my lips.

â€œAs I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed
to my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then
I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay
beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I
pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself.

â€œâ€˜What does he mean?â€™ asked a gendarme.

â€œOne of the officers went to the place I directed.

â€œâ€˜He means,â€™ replied the man upon his return, â€˜that he got in that
way;â€™ and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through.

â€œThen I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and
energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while
I managed to stammer forth:

â€œâ€˜I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!â€™

â€œA couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my
breast.

â€œâ€˜Stir but a step,â€™ said they, â€˜and you are a dead man.â€™

â€œâ€˜Why should you threaten me with death,â€™ cried I, â€˜when I have already
declared my innocence?â€™

â€œâ€˜Tush, tush,â€™ cried the men; â€˜keep your innocent stories to tell to
the judge at NÃ®mes. Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice
we can give you is to do so unresistingly.â€™

â€œAlas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered
by surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be
handcuffed and tied to a horseâ€™s tail, and thus they took me to NÃ®mes.

â€œI had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near
the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he
had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear
the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my
innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of
beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every
inquiry to be made for the AbbÃ© Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of
the Pont du Gard on that morning.

â€œIf Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and
there existed no such person as the AbbÃ© Busoni, then, indeed, I was
lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance
of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.

â€œTwo months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I
must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to
obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he
would. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself
to what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the
approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of Septemberâ€”that is to say,
precisely three months and five days after the events which had
perilled my lifeâ€”the AbbÃ© Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I
should see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood
one of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having
learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened
to comply with my desire.

â€œYou may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how
minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some
degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond,
but, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every
particular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief
in all I said.

â€œAnd then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was
acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and
considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really
guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind,
I besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I
recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other
transaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best
feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of
calculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil
proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused.
When he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his
doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.

â€œI had speedy proofs that the excellent abbÃ© was engaged in my behalf,
for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be
postponed to the assizes following those now being held.

â€œIn the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of
Caderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought
back to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the
fact of his wifeâ€™s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse
for his own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for
life, and I was immediately set at liberty.â€

â€œAnd then it was, I presume,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œthat you came to me as
the bearer of a letter from the AbbÃ© Busoni?â€

â€œIt was, your excellency; the benevolent abbÃ© took an evident interest
in all that concerned me.

â€œâ€˜Your mode of life as a smuggler,â€™ said he to me one day, â€˜will be the
ruin of you; if you get out, donâ€™t take it up again.â€™

â€œâ€˜But how,â€™ inquired I, â€˜am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?â€™

â€œâ€˜A person, whose confessor I am,â€™ replied he, â€˜and who entertains a
high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a
confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give
you a letter of introduction to him.â€™

â€œâ€˜Oh, father,â€™ I exclaimed, â€˜you are very good.â€™

â€œâ€˜But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent
my recommendation.â€™

â€œI extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself by any promise he
would dictate, but he stopped me.

â€œâ€˜It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,â€™ said he; â€˜I
know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take
this,â€™ continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to
your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me
into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever
had cause to repent having done so?â€

â€œNo,â€ replied the count; â€œI take pleasure in saying that you have
served me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more
confidence in me.â€

â€œI, your excellency?â€

â€œYes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son,
you have never spoken to me of either?â€

20323m



â€œAlas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.
Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister,
I lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano
I found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible
that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my
advice, my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable
demands of Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as
long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning
he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply
him with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day,
leaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own
child, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came,
and still, with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for
his return.

â€œAs the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air,
attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon
companions. She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of
her, and one of the threeâ€”none other than the accursed Benedetto
exclaimed:

â€œâ€˜Put her to torture and sheâ€™ll soon tell us where her money is.â€™

â€œIt unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Wasilio, was at Bastia,
leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside
could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two
held poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended
to her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her
executioners. The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows,
then returned, and the three united in stifling the cries of terror
incited by the sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta
feet foremost towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an
avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her
clothes caught fire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in
order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with
flames, Assunta rushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she
flew to the windows, but they were also secured; then the neighbors
heard frightful shrieks; it was Assunta calling for help. The cries
died away in groans, and next morning, as soon as Wasilioâ€™s wife could
muster up courage to venture abroad, she caused the door of our
dwelling to be opened by the public authorities, when Assunta, although
dreadfully burnt, was found still breathing; every drawer and closet in
the house had been forced open, and the money stolen. Benedetto never
again appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day either seen
or heard anything concerning him.

â€œIt was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your
excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned
Benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my
sister, since she was dead.â€

â€œAnd in what light did you view the occurrence?â€ inquired Monte Cristo.

â€œAs a punishment for the crime I had committed,â€ answered Bertuccio.
â€œOh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!â€

â€œTruly they are,â€ murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.

â€œAnd now,â€ resumed Bertuccio, â€œyour excellency may, perhaps, be able to
comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first timeâ€”this
garden, the actual scene of my crimeâ€”must have given rise to
reflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and
depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who
was pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a
shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on
the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground
was dug to receive the corpse of his child.â€

â€œEverything is possible,â€ said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on
which he had been sitting; â€œeven,â€ he added in an inaudible voice,
â€œeven that the procureur be not dead. The AbbÃ© Busoni did right to send
you to me,â€ he went on in his ordinary tone, â€œand you have done well in
relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming
any erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto,
who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace
out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?â€

â€œNo; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should
shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,
I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and
believe he is dead.â€

â€œDo not think so, Bertuccio,â€ replied the count; â€œfor the wicked are
not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special
watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.â€

â€œSo be it,â€ responded Bertuccio, â€œall I ask of heaven is that I may
never see him again. And now, your excellency,â€ he added, bowing his
head, â€œyou know everythingâ€”you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty
is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?â€

â€œMy good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
AbbÃ© Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the
instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but
one point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore,
after rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it
to its mother? There was the crime, Bertuccioâ€”that was where you became
really culpable.â€

â€œTrue, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I
acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in
recalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in
order to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which
would, in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung
to life, partly on my sisterâ€™s account, and partly from that feeling of
pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and
victorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural
and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own.
And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor
brother.â€

Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while
Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief
silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the count
said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner:

â€œIn order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last
we shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words
I have heard from the lips of the AbbÃ© Busoni. For all evils there are
two remediesâ€”time and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to
walk alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict on
you, as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful
emotions, are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like
contentment, and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my
estimation. The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of
their umbrageous boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of
shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have a
garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the
imagination, and furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose
leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will.
This to me, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a
straight wall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no
fear of ghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had
been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the
living in a single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your
mind. Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying
moments than you found the AbbÃ© Busoni, send for me, if I am still on
earth, and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually
calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the
ocean called eternity.â€

Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte
Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured:

â€œHere, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infantâ€™s grave
was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this
corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping
apartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these
particulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,
I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.â€

After making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered
his carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression
of his masterâ€™s features, took his seat beside the driver without
uttering a word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.

That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, the
Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the
party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him
to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal
attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to
Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to
make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the
attentive Nubian:

â€œIt is half-past eleven oâ€™clock; HaydÃ©e will soon be here. Have the
French attendants been summoned to await her coming?â€

Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair
Greek, which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried
entrance, that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined
their existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three
fingers of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut
his eyes, and feigned to sleep.

â€œI understand,â€ said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Aliâ€™s
pantomime; â€œyou mean to tell me that three female attendants await
their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.â€

Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.

â€œMadame will be tired tonight,â€ continued Monte Cristo, â€œand will, no
doubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not to weary her with
questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. You will
also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of
this country.â€

He bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge.
The gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and stopped at the
steps. The count hastily descended, presented himself at the already
opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young woman,
completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with
gold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and kissed
it with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words passed between
them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods converse.
The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness, while the
count replied with an air of gentle gravity.

Preceded by Ali, who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the
young lady, who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte
Cristoâ€™s companion in Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while the
count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour
every light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been
thought that all its inmates slept.



 Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit

About two oâ€™clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of
magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a
person, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a
white waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown
trousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his
eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so
little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles
stamped on his featuresâ€”a person, in a word, who, although evidently
past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards
from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the
armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the
porterâ€™s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if
he were within.

While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the
garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants
who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be somewhat
impertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than
intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,
they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and
projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the
flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull,
which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears,
combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the
eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage
must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when
they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the
red ribbon that depended from his button-hole.

The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the
porterâ€™s lodge, saying:

â€œPray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?â€

â€œHis excellency does reside here,â€ replied the concierge; â€œbutâ€”â€”â€ added
he, glancing an inquiring look at Ali. Ali returned a sign in the
negative.

â€œBut what?â€ asked the groom.

â€œHis excellency does not receive visitors today.â€

â€œThen here is my masterâ€™s card, the Baron Danglars. You will take it to
the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my
master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.â€

â€œI never speak to his excellency,â€ replied the concierge; â€œthe valet de
chambre will carry your message.â€

The groom returned to the carriage.

â€œWell?â€ asked Danglars.

The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated
what the concierge had said.

â€œBless me,â€ murmured Baron Danglars, â€œthis must surely be a prince
instead of a count by their styling him â€˜excellency,â€™ and only
venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre.
However, it does not signify; he has a letter of credit on me, so I
must see him when he requires his money.â€

Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his
coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, â€œTo the
Chamber of Deputies.â€

Apprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind
the blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of
an excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
garden, and servants.

â€œThat fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,â€ said the count in a tone
of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its ivory case. â€œHow comes it
that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat, receding,
serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped head, and sharp-hooked
nose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali,â€ cried he, striking at the same
time on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. â€œSummon Bertuccio,â€ said the
count. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment.

â€œDid your excellency desire to see me?â€ inquired he.

â€œI did,â€ replied the count. â€œYou no doubt observed the horses standing
a few minutes since at the door?â€

â€œCertainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable
beauty.â€

â€œThen how comes it,â€ said Monte Cristo with a frown, â€œthat, when I
desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in
Paris, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my
stables?â€

At the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count
spoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head.

â€œIt is not your fault, my good Ali,â€ said the count in the Arabic
language, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of
showing, either in voice or faceâ€”â€œit is not your fault. You do not
understand the points of English horses.â€

The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity.

â€œPermit me to assure your excellency,â€ said Bertuccio, â€œthat the horses
you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours.â€

Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders. â€œIt seems, sir steward,â€ said he,
â€œthat you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as
care to pay the price.â€

â€œHis excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000
francs for his horses?â€

â€œVery well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an
opportunity of doubling his capital.â€

â€œIs your excellency really in earnest?â€ inquired the steward.

Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words
with the look of one equally surprised and displeased.

â€œI have to pay a visit this evening,â€ replied he. â€œI desire that these
horses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my
carriage.â€

Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door,
he paused, and then said, â€œAt what oâ€™clock does your excellency wish
the carriage and horses to be ready?â€

â€œAt five oâ€™clock,â€ replied the count.

â€œI beg your excellencyâ€™s pardon,â€ interposed the steward in a
deprecating manner, â€œfor venturing to observe that it is already two
oâ€™clock.â€

â€œI am perfectly aware of that fact,â€ answered Monte Cristo calmly.
Then, turning towards Ali, he said, â€œLet all the horses in my stables
be led before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those
she prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying
whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served
in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to
come hither.â€

Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.

â€œMonsieur Baptistin,â€ said the count, â€œyou have been in my service one
year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or
demerits of those about me. You suit me very well.â€

Baptistin bowed low.

â€œIt only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?â€

â€œOh, your excellency!â€ exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.

â€œListen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,â€ replied Monte
Cristo. â€œYou receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services hereâ€”more
than many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his
country, obtains. You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who
work ten times harder than you do for their money. Then, though
yourself a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care
of your clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you.
Again, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet,
amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.â€

â€œNay, indeed, your excellency.â€

â€œI am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your
profits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so
lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I
neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error I
readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My
commands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and I would rather
be obliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they
should be misunderstood. I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to
know, and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I
should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone
favorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my
conduct, that very instant you would quit my service. You may now
retire. I never caution my servants a second timeâ€”remember that.â€

Baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.

â€œI forgot to mention to you,â€ said the count, â€œthat I lay yearly aside
a certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am
compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in
this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those
domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my
death. You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun
to accumulateâ€”let it continue to do so.â€

This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding
one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.

â€œI assure your excellency,â€ said he, â€œthat at least it shall be my
study to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take M. Ali
as my model.â€

â€œBy no means,â€ replied the count in the most frigid tones; â€œAli has
many faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot possibly
serve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid
servant, but a mere slaveâ€”a dog, who, should he fail in his duty
towards me, I should not discharge from my service, but kill.â€

Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.

â€œYou seem incredulous,â€ said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the
Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French.

The Nubian smiled assentingly to his masterâ€™s words, then, kneeling on
one knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration
of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the
wonder and stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the
valet de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where
they conversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock
pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was
wanted one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three
Bertuccio. The steward entered.

â€œMy horses,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œThey are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
desired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?â€

â€œNo, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.â€

The count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage
drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning
as the property of Danglars. As he passed them he said:

â€œThey are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to
purchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured
them sooner.â€

â€œIndeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in
obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.â€

â€œDoes the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,â€
inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.

â€œNay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.
Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?â€

â€œTo the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la ChaussÃ©e dâ€™Antin.â€

This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which
a flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with a
respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.

â€œI have another commission for you, M. Bertuccio,â€ said he; â€œI am
desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandyâ€”for instance,
between Le Havre and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range. It will
be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small
harbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at
anchor. She draws only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant
readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make
the requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you
have met with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the
advantages desired, purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette
must now, I think, be on her way to FÃ©camp, must she not?â€

20333m



â€œCertainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening we
quitted Marseilles.â€

â€œAnd the yacht.â€

â€œWas ordered to remain at Martigues.â€

â€œâ€™Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in
charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.â€

â€œAnd the steamboat?â€

â€œShe is at ChÃ¢lons?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThe same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.â€

â€œVery good.â€

â€œWhen you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of
horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.â€

â€œYour excellency may depend upon me.â€

The Count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps,
and sprang into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the
bankerâ€™s house.

Danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad
committee. But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his
visitor was announced. As the countâ€™s title sounded on his ear he rose,
and addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other
Chamber, he said:

â€œGentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most
ridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,â€”Thomson & French,
the Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the
Count of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me.
I confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course
of my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it
has greatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to
call on the pretended countâ€”if he were a real count he wouldnâ€™t be so
rich. But, would you believe it, â€˜He was not receiving.â€™ So the master
of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a
capricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the house in the
Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es is his own property, and certainly it was very decently
kept up. But,â€ pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles, â€œan
order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part
of the banker to whom that order is given. I am very anxious to see
this man. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it
little knew whom they had to deal with. â€˜They laugh best who laugh
last!â€™â€

Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree
of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the
assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous
furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the
ChaussÃ©e dâ€™Antin. It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to
be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much
luxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and
Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which,
mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being
brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the
ceiling.

The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the
room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the
count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair,
covered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down.

20335m



â€œI have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.â€

The count bowed.

â€œAnd I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
and member of the Chamber of Deputies?â€

Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baronâ€™s card.

Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.

â€œYou will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your
title when I first addressed you,â€ he said, â€œbut you are aware that we
are living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a
representative of the liberties of the people.â€

â€œSo much so,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œthat while you call yourself baron
you are not willing to call anybody else count.â€

â€œUpon my word, monsieur,â€ said Danglars with affected carelessness, â€œI
attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I
was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return
for services rendered, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œBut you have discarded your titles after the example set you by
Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to
follow, monsieur.â€

â€œWhy,â€ replied Danglars, â€œnot entirely so; with the servants,â€”you
understand.â€

â€œI see; to your domestics you are â€˜my lord,â€™ the journalists style you
â€˜monsieur,â€™ while your constituents call you â€˜citizen.â€™ These are
distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government. I
understand perfectly.â€

Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte
Cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn
to subjects more congenial.

â€œPermit me to inform you, Count,â€ said he, bowing, â€œthat I have
received a letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.â€

â€œI am glad to hear it, baron,â€”for I must claim the privilege of
addressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the
bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country
where barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the
letter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that
will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you
for money myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Danglars, â€œbut I confess I didnâ€™t quite comprehend its
meaning.â€

â€œIndeed?â€

â€œAnd for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
order to beg for an explanation.â€

â€œGo on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you
desire.â€

â€œWhy,â€ said Danglars, â€œin the letterâ€”I believe I have it about meâ€â€”here
he felt in his breast-pocketâ€”â€œyes, here it is. Well, this letter gives
the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house.â€

â€œWell, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?â€

â€œMerely the term _unlimited_â€”nothing else, certainly.â€

â€œIs not that word known in France? The people who wrote are
Anglo-Germans, you know.â€

â€œOh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;
but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have
doubts.â€

â€œIs it possible?â€ asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the
utmost simplicity and candor. â€œIs it possible that Thomson & French are
not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me what you
think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some
considerable property in their hands.â€

â€œThomson & French are perfectly solvent,â€ replied Danglars, with an
almost mocking smile; â€œbut the word _unlimited_, in financial affairs,
is so extremely vague.â€

â€œIs, in fact, unlimited,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œPrecisely what I was about to say,â€ cried Danglars. â€œNow what is vague
is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, â€˜when in doubt, keep
out.â€™â€

â€œMeaning to say,â€ rejoined Monte Cristo, â€œthat however Thomson & French
may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron
Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.â€

â€œNot at all.â€

â€œPlainly enough; Messrs. Thomson & French set no bounds to their
engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise
man, according to his own showing.â€

â€œMonsieur,â€ replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air,
â€œthe extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.â€

â€œIt seems, then, reserved for me,â€ said Monte Cristo coldly, â€œto be the
first to do so.â€

â€œBy what right, sir?â€

â€œBy right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you
have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.â€

Once more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been
worsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat
awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo
on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a
certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus
possessed the advantage.

â€œWell, sir,â€ resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, â€œI will endeavor
to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum
you propose to draw upon me?â€

â€œWhy, truly,â€ replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of
the ground he had gained, â€œmy reason for desiring an â€˜unlimitedâ€™ credit
was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.â€

The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So
throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and
purse-proud air:

â€œLet me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then
be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however
limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you
even to require a millionâ€”â€”â€

â€œI beg your pardon,â€ interposed Monte Cristo.

â€œI said a million,â€ replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.

â€œBut could I do with a million?â€ retorted the count. â€œMy dear sir, if a
trifle like that could suffice me, I should never have given myself the
trouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my smiling when you
speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or
dressing-case.â€

And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case
containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the
treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer. A man
like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of
correction. The effect of the present revelation was stunning; he
trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as
he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.

â€œCome, come,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œconfess honestly that you have not
perfect confidence in Thomson & French. I understand, and foreseeing
that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of
affairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that
you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein & Eskeles of
Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon
M. Lafitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare
you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of
these two firms.â€

The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a
trembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them
carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the
signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as
insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.

â€œOh, sir,â€ said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the
authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the
power of gold personified in the man before him,â€”â€œthree letters of
unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon
me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.â€

â€œNay,â€ answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, â€œâ€™tis not
for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be
incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?â€

â€œWhatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.â€

â€œWhy,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œsince we mutually understand each
otherâ€”for such I presume is the case?â€ Danglars bowed assentingly. â€œYou
are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your
mind?â€

â€œOh, my dear count,â€ exclaimed Danglars, â€œI never for an instant
entertained such a feeling towards you.â€

â€œNo, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we
have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and
suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable
expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions toâ€”â€”â€

â€œSix millions!â€ gasped Danglarsâ€”â€œso be it.â€

â€œThen, if I should require more,â€ continued Monte Cristo in a careless
manner, â€œwhy, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present
intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that
period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However, we
shall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow. I
shall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my
steward.â€

â€œThe money you desire shall be at your house by ten oâ€™clock tomorrow
morning, my dear count,â€ replied Danglars. â€œHow would you like to have
it? in gold, silver, or notes?â€

â€œHalf in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,â€ said
the count, rising from his seat.

â€œI must confess to you, count,â€ said Danglars, â€œthat I have hitherto
imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of
Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?â€

â€œIt has been in the family a very long while,â€ returned Monte Cristo,
â€œa sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain
period of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the
capital. The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these
riches occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed
by me within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject,
therefore, is easily accounted for. However, you will be better
informed as to me and my possessions ere long.â€

And the count, while pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them
with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor
Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay.

â€œWith your tastes, and means of gratifying them,â€ continued Danglars,
â€œyou will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor
miserable millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are an
admirer of paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you
appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will
permit me, I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed
entirely of works by the ancient mastersâ€”warranted as such. Not a
modern picture among them. I cannot endure the modern school of
painting.â€

â€œYou are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great
faultâ€”that they have not yet had time to become old.â€

â€œOr will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen,
Bartoloni, and Canova?â€”all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I
think but very indifferently of our French sculptors.â€

â€œYou have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your
compatriots.â€

â€œBut all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each
other. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable
to you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsâ€”excuse my
impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a
member of the family.â€

Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor;
Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.

â€œIs the baroness at home?â€ inquired Danglars.

â€œYes, my lord,â€ answered the man.

â€œAnd alone?â€

â€œNo, my lord, madame has visitors.â€

â€œHave you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or
do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_?â€

â€œNo, indeed,â€ replied Monte Cristo with a smile, â€œI do not arrogate to
myself the right of so doing.â€

â€œAnd who is with madame?â€”M. Debray?â€ inquired Danglars, with an air of
indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as
he was with the secrets of the bankerâ€™s domestic life.

â€œYes, my lord,â€ replied the servant, â€œM. Debray is with madame.â€

Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, â€œM.
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the
Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered
herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient
families in France. Her maiden name was De ServiÃ¨res, and her first
husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.â€

â€œI have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already
met M. Lucien Debray.â€

â€œAh, indeed?â€ said Danglars; â€œand where was that?â€

â€œAt the house of M. de Morcerf.â€

â€œAh! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?â€

â€œWe were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.â€

â€œTrue, true,â€ cried Danglars. â€œLet me see; have I not heard talk of
some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his
having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used to
amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return
from Italy.â€

â€œHer ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,â€ said the servant,
who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress.

â€œWith your permission,â€ said Danglars, bowing, â€œI will precede you, to
show you the way.â€

â€œBy all means,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œI follow you.â€



 Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays

The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of
apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy
magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached
the boudoir of Madame Danglarsâ€”a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with
pink satin, covered with white Indian muslin. The chairs were of
ancient workmanship and materials; over the doors were painted sketches
of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher;
and at each side pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with
the furnishings of this charming apartment, the only one throughout the
great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was,
it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out
by M. Danglars and his architect, who had been selected to aid the
baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most
fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the
boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien
Debray. M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great admiration for
the antique, as it was understood during the time of the Directory,
entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his
wifeâ€™s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted
to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering
in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had
rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than
that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or
frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to
please or displease the baroness.

Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate
piece of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before
a small work-table, was turning over the pages of an album.

Lucien had found time, preparatory to the countâ€™s arrival, to relate
many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be
remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds
of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf;
and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings,
he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in
his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently
the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored
tinge of his own heated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful
stories related of the count by de Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame
Danglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional
circumstances detailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the
album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most
gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the
count, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a formal though
graceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of
distant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.

â€œBaroness,â€ said Danglars, â€œgive me leave to present to you the Count
of Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my
correspondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the
ladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take
up his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes
to spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn
parties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember
us, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble
entertainments.â€

In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame
Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man
capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had
selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.

â€œAnd when did you arrive here?â€ inquired she.

â€œYesterday morning, madame.â€

â€œComing, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe? Pardon
meâ€”at least, such I have heard is your custom.â€

â€œNay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.â€

â€œYou have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit.
Paris is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and _fÃªtes_ are
over; the Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere
except in Paris. As for the ThÃ©atre FranÃ§ais, you know, of course, that
it is nowhere. The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at
the Champ-de-Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at
either of these races, count?â€

â€œI shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good
fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas
of amusement.â€

â€œAre you fond of horses, count?â€

â€œI have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and
you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsâ€”the
fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.â€

â€œNay, count,â€ said the baroness, â€œit would have been somewhat more
gallant to have placed the ladies first.â€

â€œYou see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a
preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.â€

At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the
boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an
undertone. Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed:

â€œI cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.â€

â€œI assure you, madame,â€ replied the woman, â€œit is as I have said.â€

Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, â€œIs
this true?â€

â€œIs what true, madame?â€ inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.

â€œWhat my maid tells me.â€

â€œBut what does she tell you?â€

â€œThat when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage,
he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his
knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?â€

â€œBe kind enough, madame, to listen to me,â€ said Danglars.

â€œOh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what
explanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between us;
but, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,â€ continued the
baroness, â€œamong the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are
two that belong exclusively to meâ€”a pair of the handsomest and most
spirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you, at least, M.
Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you my
beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised
Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the
Bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables
they are goneâ€”positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them
to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry
francs. Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary
speculators!â€

â€œMadame,â€ replied Danglars, â€œthe horses were not sufficiently quiet for
you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely
uneasy on your account.â€

â€œNonsense,â€ retorted the baroness; â€œyou could not have entertained any
alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have
had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris. But,
perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?â€

â€œMy dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise you
another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and
steady.â€

The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt,
while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture,
turned towards Monte Cristo and said,â€”â€œUpon my word, count, I am quite
sorry not to have met you sooner. You are setting up an establishment,
of course?â€

â€œWhy, yes,â€ replied the count.

â€œI should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I have
almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious
to get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young man.â€

â€œI am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,â€ said Monte
Cristo; â€œbut this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of
carriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are.
Come, M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your
opinion upon them.â€

As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his wife.

â€œI could not tell you before others,â€ said he in a low tone, â€œthe
reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was
offered me this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent upon
ruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to
purchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000 francs
by the sale of them. Come, donâ€™t look so angry, and you shall have
4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and EugÃ©nie shall
have 2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasnâ€™t I right
to part with the horses?â€

Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt.

â€œGreat heavens?â€ suddenly exclaimed Debray.

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked the baroness.

â€œI cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we were
speaking of, harnessed to the countâ€™s carriage!â€

â€œMy dappled grays?â€ demanded the baroness, springing to the window.
â€œâ€™Tis indeed they!â€ said she.

Danglars looked absolutely stupefied.

â€œHow very singular,â€ cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.

â€œI cannot believe it,â€ murmured the banker. Madame Danglars whispered a
few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying,
â€œThe baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.â€

â€œI scarcely know,â€ replied the count; â€œit was a little surprise
prepared for me by my steward, and cost meâ€”well, somewhere about 30,000
francs.â€

Debray conveyed the countâ€™s reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked
so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air
towards him.

â€œSee,â€ said the count, â€œhow very ungrateful women are. Your kind
attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of
the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her. But
so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which
is dangerous to that which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my dear
baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and
allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,
why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.â€

Danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming
scene between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that
of Olympic Jove, predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering
clouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglarsâ€™
rage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take
his leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to
destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and
departed, leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.

20347m



â€œExcellent,â€ murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away. â€œAll
has gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of this family is
henceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by
which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wifeâ€”delightful!
Still,â€ added he, â€œamid all this, I have not yet been presented to
Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should have been
glad to make. But,â€ he went on with his peculiar smile, â€œI am here in
Paris, and have plenty of time before meâ€”by and by will do for that.â€

With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two
hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle
from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite
â€œdappled grays,â€ protesting that he could not endure the idea of making
his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that
his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely
womanâ€™s regrets. The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she
had seen on them in the morning; only, by the countâ€™s orders, in the
centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had
been fastened a large diamond.

To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the
whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.

During the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied
by Ali. The following day, about three oâ€™clock, a single blow struck on
the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.

â€œAli,â€ observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, â€œyou
have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are
in throwing the lasso, have you not?â€

Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the
affirmative.

â€œI thought I did not mistake. With your lasso you could stop an ox?â€

Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.

â€œOr a tiger?â€

Ali bowed his head in token of assent.

â€œA lion even?â€

Ali sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso,
then of a strangled lion.

â€œI understand,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œyou wish to tell me you have hunted
the lion?â€

Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed
both chased and captured many lions.

â€œBut do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing
forwards with ungovernable fury?â€

The Nubian smiled.

â€œIt is well,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œThen listen to me. Ere long a
carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses
you saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must
manage to stop those horses before my door.â€

Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement
immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line
he had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him
gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased
and gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and,
seating himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte
Cristo re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his
plan.

Still, as five oâ€™clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience
and uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in
a room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with
restless steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the
sound of approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but
the regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his
chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment
of his favorite occupation.

Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and
almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild,
ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to
restrain their furious speed.

In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight
clasped in each otherâ€™s arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them even
of the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as it
flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,
and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.

Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by
the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from
his box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,
and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain,
sunk beside his companion.

All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the
recital. The brief space had, however, been sufficient for a man,
followed by a number of servants, to rush from the house before which
the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of the
carriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the
cushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her bosom
the young boy, who had lost consciousness. Monte Cristo carried them
both to the salon, and deposited them on a sofa.

â€œCompose yourself, madame,â€ said he; â€œall danger is over.â€ The woman
looked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive than
any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still
continued insensible. â€œI understand the nature of your alarms, madame,â€
said the count, carefully examining the child, â€œbut I assure you there
is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has
not received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects
of terror, and will soon pass.â€

â€œAre you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See how
deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your
motherâ€”open your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity
send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much
for the recovery of my boy.â€

With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to
the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a
casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass
incrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of
which he let fall a single drop on the childâ€™s lips. Scarcely had it
reached them, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his
eyes, and eagerly gazed around him. At this, the delight of the mother
was almost frantic.

â€œWhere am I?â€ exclaimed she; â€œand to whom am I indebted for so happy a
termination to my late dreadful alarm?â€

â€œMadame,â€ answered the count, â€œyou are under the roof of one who
esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a
further continuance of your sufferings.â€

â€œMy wretched curiosity has brought all this about,â€ pursued the lady.
â€œAll Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglarsâ€™ beautiful horses,
and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the
high praise given to them.â€

â€œIs it possible,â€ exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,
â€œthat these horses belong to the baroness?â€

â€œThey do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame
Danglars?â€

20351m



â€œI have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger
that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been
the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have
incurred. I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the
baroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them
back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them
from my hands.â€

â€œYou are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine
has talked to me so much?â€

â€œYou have rightly guessed, madame,â€ replied the count.

â€œAnd I am Madame HÃ©loÃ¯se de Villefort.â€

The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first
time.

â€œHow grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness; how
thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence
of his wife and child! Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of
your intrepid servant, this dear child and myself must both have
perished.â€

â€œIndeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.â€

â€œI trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your
man.â€

â€œI beseech you, madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo â€œnot to spoil Ali, either
by too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to acquire the habit
of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may
render. Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging
his duty to me.â€

â€œNay,â€ interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style
adopted by the count made a deep impression, â€œnay, but consider that to
preserve my life he has risked his own.â€

â€œHis life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my
having myself saved him from death.â€

Madame de Villefort made no further reply; her mind was utterly
absorbed in the contemplation of the person who, from the first instant
she saw him, had made so powerful an impression on her.

During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo
scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in
her arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments. The child was
small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A mass of straight black hair,
defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting
forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to
eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness
for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips, which
had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the
deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the childâ€™s
face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so
young. His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from
the encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket
from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without
asking permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a
spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to
pull the corks out of all the bottles.

â€œTouch nothing, my little friend,â€ cried the count eagerly; â€œsome of
those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.â€

Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her sonâ€™s arm, drew
him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost
upon the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de
Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child
still closer towards her, she said:

â€œEdward, dearest, do you see that good man? He has shown very great
courage and resolution, for he exposed his own life to stop the horses
that were running away with us, and would certainly have dashed the
carriage to pieces. Thank him, then, my child, in your very best
manner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor I would have
been alive to speak our thanks.â€

The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful
manner, saying, â€œHeâ€™s too ugly.â€

20353m



The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and
moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having
been committed.

â€œThis lady,â€ said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language,
â€œis desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives;
but the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.â€

Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he
gazed without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the
nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had
been wounded to the heart.

â€œWill you permit me to inquire,â€ said Madame de Villefort, as she arose
to take her leave, â€œwhether you usually reside here?â€

â€œNo, I do not,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œit is a small place I have
purchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue des
Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright,
and are, no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your
wishes, I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one
of my carriages, and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,â€ continued
he, addressing the boy with a smiling air, â€œwill have the honor of
driving you home, while your coachman remains here to attend to the
necessary repairs of your calash. As soon as that important business is
concluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it
direct to Madame Danglars.â€

â€œI dare not return with those dreadful horses,â€ said Madame de
Villefort.

â€œYou will see,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œthat they will be as different
as possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle and
docile as lambs.â€

Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who
had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed
their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar,
and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths. Then,
commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their
bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd
collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified
animals to the countâ€™s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and
mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had
witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same
horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle
manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that
could be obtained from the celebrated â€œdappled grays,â€ now changed into
a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace,
kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than
two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©.

20355m



Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:â€”

â€œDear Hermine,â€”I have just had a wonderful escape from the most
imminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo
we were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see
today. I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your
eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause
to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell
far short of his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they
darted forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate,
that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but
that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded
their progress, when a strange-looking man,â€”an Arab, a negro, or a
Nubian, at least a black of some nation or otherâ€”at a signal from the
count, whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated
animals, even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and
certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape. The count then
hastened to us, and took us into his house, where he speedily recalled
my poor Edward to life. He sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will
be returned to you tomorrow. You will find your horses in bad
condition, from the results of this accident; they seem thoroughly
stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man. The
count, however, has commissioned me to assure you that two or three
daysâ€™ rest, with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time,
will bring them back to as fine, that is as terrifying, a condition as
they were in yesterday.

20356m



Adieu! I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but,
after all, I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses,
more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to
the Count of Monte Cristo,â€”and certainly that illustrious personage,
apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of,
seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one,
delight in solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another
drive to the Bois behind your horses.

Edward endured the accident with miraculous courageâ€”he did not utter a
single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from
his eyes after it was over. I doubt not you will consider these praises
the result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in
that delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends many affectionate
remembrances to your dear EugÃ©nie. I embrace you with all my heart.

HÃ©loÃ¯se de Villefort.

P.S.â€”Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte
Cristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made
M. de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be
returned.

That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert
related it to his mother; ChÃ¢teau-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey
Club, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;
even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of
the countâ€™s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
aristocracy.

Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their
names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of
renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all
the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.

As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of HÃ©loÃ¯se to the
letter,â€”donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered
the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and
drove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es.

 Chapter 48. Ideology

If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the
ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the
significance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well
at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,
whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked
upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced
a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly
supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de
Villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his
eminence like a Harlay or a MolÃ©. His drawing-room, under the
regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first
marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris
salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of
rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A freezing politeness, a
strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for
theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,â€”these were
the elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.

30023m



M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
His relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with
dignity and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so
many things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but
sometimes consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been
possible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who
rebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.
This fortress was his post as kingâ€™s attorney, all the advantages of
which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have
resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by
opposition.

Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife
visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where
the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were
accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a
manifestation of professed superiorityâ€”in fact, the application of the
axiom, _Pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think
well of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays
than that of the Greeks, â€œKnow thyself,â€ a knowledge for which, in our
days, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous
science of _knowing others_.

To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his
enemies, he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were
neither the one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He
had a haughty bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or
insolently piercing and inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had
built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based.

M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the
least wearisome man in France. He gave a ball every year, at which he
appeared for a quarter of an hour only,â€”that is to say, five-and-forty
minutes less than the king is visible at his balls. He was never seen
at the theatres, at concerts, or in any place of public resort.
Occasionally, but seldom, he played at whist, and then care was taken
to select partners worthy of himâ€”sometimes they were ambassadors,
sometimes archbishops, or sometimes a prince, or a president, or some
dowager duchess.

Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count
of Monte Cristoâ€™s door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort
at the moment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing
on a map the route from St. Petersburg to China.

The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would
have employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or
rather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as
assistant attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had
made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being
slender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his
deep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes
seemed to be an integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in
black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance
was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost
imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of
blood traced with a delicate brush.

Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with
irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and
who, distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social
prodigies, was much more despised to look upon â€œthe noble stranger,â€ as
Monte Cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new
fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy
See, or a sultan of the _Thousand and One Nights_.

â€œSir,â€ said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in
their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest
themselves in society, â€œsir, the signal service which you yesterday
rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my
thanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express
to you my overwhelming gratitude.â€

And as he said this, the â€œeye severeâ€ of the magistrate had lost
nothing of its habitual arrogance. He spoke in a voice of the
procureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders
which caused his flatterers to say (as we have before observed) that he
was the living statue of the law.

â€œMonsieur,â€ replied the count, with a chilling air, â€œI am very happy to
have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say
that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good
fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to
dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly
great honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish
of the favor which he now bestows on me,â€”a favor which, however
estimable, is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own
consciousness.â€

Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected,
started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the
armor he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from
that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of
Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.

He glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the
conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic. He saw
the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered, and
said:

â€œYou seem geographically engaged, sir? It is a rich study for you, who,
as I learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ replied the count; â€œI have sought to make of the human
race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individualsâ€”a
physiological study. I have believed it was much easier to descend from
the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole. It is an
algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown
quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg
of you.â€

Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to
take the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell
back into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort
entered. Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having
his back towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical
chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,â€”a
conversation which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with
Danglars and Morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the
situation.

â€œAh, you philosophize,â€ replied Villefort, after a momentâ€™s silence,
during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he
took breath; â€œwell, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to
do, I should seek a more amusing occupation.â€

â€œWhy, in truth, sir,â€ was Monte Cristoâ€™s reply, â€œman is but an ugly
caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you
said, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now, really, let me ask,
sir, have you?â€”do you believe you have anything to do? or to speak in
plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called
anything?â€

Villefortâ€™s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly
made by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate
had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more
exactly, it was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur
exerted himself to reply.

â€œSir,â€ he responded, â€œyou are a stranger, and I believe you say
yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental
countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in
barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.â€

â€œOh, yesâ€”yes, I do, sir; it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients. I
know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially
that I have occupied myselfâ€”it is with the criminal procedure of all
nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that
it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation,
that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.â€

â€œIf this law were adopted, sir,â€ said the procureur, â€œit would greatly
simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not
(as you just observed) have much to do.â€

â€œIt may, perhaps, come to this in time,â€ observed Monte Cristo; â€œyou
know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and
simplicity is always perfection.â€

â€œIn the meanwhile,â€ continued the magistrate, â€œour codes are in full
force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic
customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you
will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs
tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong
power of brain to retain it.â€

â€œI agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with
respect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code,
but as regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish,
Japanese, Hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and
thus I was right, when I said to you, that relatively (you know that
everything is relative, sir)â€”that relatively to what I have done, you
have very little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you
have yet a great deal to learn.â€

â€œBut with what motive have you learned all this?â€ inquired Villefort,
in astonishment.

Monte Cristo smiled.

â€œReally, sir,â€ he observed, â€œI see that in spite of the reputation
which you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from
the material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending
with manâ€”that is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which
it is possible for human understanding to embrace.â€

â€œPray, sir, explain yourself,â€ said Villefort, more and more
astonished, â€œI really doâ€”notâ€”understand youâ€”perfectly.â€

â€œI say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of
nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the
sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize
before you and around you any but those office-holders whose
commissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men
whom God has put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by
giving them a mission to follow out, instead of a post to fillâ€”I say
that they escape your narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus
that human weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs.
Tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young
man. The nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a
conqueror similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to
reveal their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one
was compelled to say, â€˜I am the angel of the Lordâ€™; and the other, â€˜I
am the hammer of God,â€™ in order that the divine essence in both might
be revealed.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he
was speaking to a mystic or a madman, â€œyou consider yourself as one of
those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?â€

â€œAnd why not?â€ said Monte Cristo coldly.

â€œYour pardon, sir,â€ replied Villefort, quite astounded, â€œbut you will
excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I
should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far
surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not usual
with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like
yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortuneâ€”at least, so it is
saidâ€”and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely
repeat;â€”it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy beings
to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in
philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has
disinherited from the goods of this world.â€

â€œReally, sir,â€ retorted the count, â€œhave you attained the eminent
situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without
having met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which must
have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty, to divine, at a glance,
the kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a magistrate be
not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty
expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search
hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with
more or less of alloy?â€

â€œSir,â€ said Villefort, â€œupon my word, you overcome me. I really never
heard a person speak as you do.â€

â€œBecause you remain eternally encircled in a round of general
conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper
spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.â€

â€œAnd you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and
invisible beings mingle amongst us?â€

â€œWhy should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without
which you could not for a moment exist?â€

â€œThen we do not see those beings to whom you allude?â€

â€œYes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume
a material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to
them, and they reply to you.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Villefort, smiling, â€œI confess I should like to be warned
when one of these beings is in contact with me.â€

â€œYou have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just
now, and I now again warn you.â€

â€œThen you yourself are one of these marked beings?â€

â€œYes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself
in a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited
either by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration
of language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an
Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniardâ€”I am
a cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what
country will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You
believe me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility
and purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an
Arab; Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; HaydÃ©e, my slave,
thinks me a Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no
country, asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man
as my brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the
obstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only
two adversariesâ€”I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I
subdue even them,â€”they are time and distance. There is a third, and the
most terribleâ€”that is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can
stop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which I
aim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms. What men
call the chances of fateâ€”namely, ruin, change, circumstancesâ€”I have
fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will
not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and
therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from
the mouths of kingsâ€”for kings have need, and other persons have fear of
you. For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as
incongruously organized as ours, â€˜Perhaps some day I shall have to do
with the kingâ€™s attorneyâ€™?â€

â€œBut can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant of
France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.â€

â€œI know it sir,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbut when I visit a country I
begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom
I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as,
perhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that
the kingâ€™s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,
would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.â€

â€œThat is to say,â€ replied Villefort with hesitation, â€œthat human nature
being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.â€

â€œFaults or crimes,â€ responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.

â€œAnd that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your
brothersâ€”for you have said so,â€ observed Villefort in a tone that
faltered somewhatâ€”â€œyou alone are perfect.â€

â€œNo, not perfect,â€ was the countâ€™s reply; â€œonly impenetrable, thatâ€™s
all. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is
displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you
by my second-sight.â€

â€œNo, no,â€”by no means,â€ said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to
abandon his ground. â€œNo; by your brilliant and almost sublime
conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no
longer talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians
in their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies,
occasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we
are theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will
say to you, rude as it may seem, â€˜My brother, you sacrifice greatly to
pride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.â€™â€

30029m



â€œAbove us all, sir,â€ was Monte Cristoâ€™s response, in a tone and with an
emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered. â€œI have my
pride for menâ€”serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass
without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside that pride before
God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.â€

â€œThen, count, I admire you,â€ said Villefort, who, for the first time in
this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown
personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. â€œYes, and I
say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious, or
impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same
thingâ€”then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of
predominance. Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.â€

â€œI have, sir.â€

â€œAnd what may it be?â€

â€œI too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by
Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed
me all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to
me, â€˜Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?â€™ I
reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and
then I replied, â€˜Listen,â€”I have always heard of Providence, and yet I
have never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make
me believe that he exists. I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel
that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is
to recompense and punish.â€™ Satan bowed his head, and groaned. â€˜You
mistake,â€™ he said, â€˜Providence does exist, only you have never seen
him, because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have
seen nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs,
and moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of
the agents of that Providence.â€™ The bargain was concluded. I may
sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?â€ added Monte Cristo. â€œIf the
thing were to do again, I would again do it.â€

Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.

â€œCount,â€ he inquired, â€œhave you any relations?â€

â€œNo, sir, I am alone in the world.â€

â€œSo much the worse.â€

â€œWhy?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œBecause then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down
your pride. You say you fear nothing but death?â€

â€œI did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could
check the execution of my plans.â€

â€œAnd old age?â€

â€œMy end will be achieved before I grow old.â€

â€œAnd madness?â€

â€œI have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,â€”_non bis in idem_. It
is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full
application.â€

30031m



â€œSir,â€ continued Villefort, â€œthere is something to fear besides death,
old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexyâ€”that
lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which
brings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you
are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are
but an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this
is called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than
apoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation
at my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father,
M. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French
Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,
seconded by a most powerful organizationâ€”a man who has not, perhaps,
like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to
overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like
you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of
Providence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on
the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an
hour, but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the
old Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the
guillotine, the cannon, and the daggerâ€”M. Noirtier, playing with
revolutionsâ€”M. Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from
which pawns, rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the
king was checkmatedâ€”M. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning
_poor M. Noirtier_, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the
weakest creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine;
a dumb and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may
be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its
decay.â€

â€œAlas, sir,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œthis spectacle is neither strange to my
eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like my
fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead
matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,
although present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,
St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison
you have made, and yet I can well understand that a fatherâ€™s sufferings
may effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you, sir,
since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this
terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to
your family.â€

â€œIt would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a
compensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to
the tomb, are two children just entering into lifeâ€”Valentine, the
daughter by my first wifeâ€”Mademoiselle RenÃ©e de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€”and Edward,
the boy whose life you have this day saved.â€

â€œAnd what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?â€ inquired
Monte Cristo.

â€œMy deduction is,â€ replied Villefort, â€œthat my father, led away by his
passions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked
by the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but
one person, has visited this justice on him alone.â€

Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his
soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.

â€œAdieu, sir,â€ said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; â€œI
leave you, bearing a remembrance of youâ€”a remembrance of esteem, which
I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I
am not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have
made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.â€

The count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the
door of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by
two footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with
every mark of attention. When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a
profound sigh, and said:

â€œEnough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.â€

Then sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:

â€œI am going to madameâ€™s chamberâ€”have the carriage ready at one
oâ€™clock.â€



 Chapter 49. HaydÃ©e

It will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of
the Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other
than Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.

The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming
visitsâ€”the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over
the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged,
illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and
calmness, as, immediately after Villefortâ€™s departure, his thoughts
flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a
brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind. Even
Ali, who had hastened to obey the Countâ€™s summons, went forth from his
masterâ€™s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and
pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as
though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his
patronâ€™s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on
tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound
should dissipate his masterâ€™s happy reverie.

It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in
the apartments of HaydÃ©e, as though his oppressed spirit could not all
at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a
gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to
receive full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary
natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or
violent sensations.

The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly
unconnected with those of the count. The rooms had been fitted up in
strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the
richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk
of the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber
luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions,
that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such
as sought repose.

HaydÃ©e had three French maids, and one who was a Greek. The first three
remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons
of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave,
who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistressâ€™s
wishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most
peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat HaydÃ©e with all the
deference they would observe to a queen.

The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the
farther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular,
and lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.
HaydÃ©e was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin
spotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely
moulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the
other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich
narghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by
its passage through perfumed water. Her attitude, though perfectly
natural for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too
full of coquettish straining after effect.

Her dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair
of white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet
so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have
been taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their
movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little
slippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and
pearls. She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves,
trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice,
which, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole
of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with
three magnificent diamond clasps. The junction of the bodice and
drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves,
whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so
precious in the eyes of Parisian belles.

Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored
silk, embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled
its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the
blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue.

The extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness
that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly
and purely Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the
finely formed nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to
her race and country.

And, to complete the whole, HaydÃ©e was in the very springtide and
fulness of youthful charmsâ€”she had not yet numbered more than nineteen
or twenty summers.

Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether
it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. HaydÃ©eâ€™s
only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the
tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the
framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the
graceful tableau presented by the young girlâ€™s picturesque attitude and
appearance.

As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that
held the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said, with a
smile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken by the
women of Athens and Sparta:

â€œWhy demand permission ere you enter? Are you no longer my master, or
have I ceased to be your slave?â€

Monte Cristo returned her smile.

â€œHaydÃ©e,â€ said he, â€œyou well know.â€

â€œWhy do you address me so coldlyâ€”so distantly?â€ asked the young Greek.
â€œHave I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so, punish me as you will;
but do notâ€”do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and
constrained.â€

â€œHaydÃ©e,â€ replied the count, â€œyou know that you are now in France, and
are free.â€

â€œFree to do what?â€ asked the young girl.

â€œFree to leave me.â€

â€œLeave you? Why should I leave you?â€

â€œThat is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in societyâ€”to
visit and be visited.â€

â€œI donâ€™t wish to see anybody but you.â€

â€œAnd should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so
unjustâ€”â€”â€

â€œI have never seen anyone I preferred to you, and I have never loved
anyone but you and my father.â€

â€œMy poor child,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œthat is merely because your
father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was his
â€˜joyâ€™â€”you style me your â€˜love,â€™â€”and both of you have called me â€˜my
child.â€™â€

â€œDo you remember your father, HaydÃ©e?â€

The young Greek smiled.

â€œHe is here, and here,â€ said she, touching her eyes and her heart.

â€œAnd where am I?â€ inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.

â€œYou?â€ cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, â€œyou are
everywhere!â€ Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in
his, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child of
nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek.

â€œYou now understand, HaydÃ©e,â€ said the count, â€œthat from this moment
you are absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are
at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it
may suit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute
mistress of your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your
apartments as may seem most agreeable to you. A carriage waits your
orders, and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire
to go. There is but one favor I would entreat of you.â€

â€œSpeak.â€

â€œGuard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the
past; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your
illustrious father or ill-fated mother.â€

â€œI have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one.â€

â€œIt is possible, HaydÃ©e, that so perfect a seclusion, though
conformable with the habits and customs of the East, may not be
practicable in Paris. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our
manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome,
Florence, Milan, and Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days,
whether you remain here or return to the East.â€

The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said
with touching earnestness, â€œWhether _we_ return to the East, you mean
to say, my lord, do you not?â€

â€œMy child,â€ returned Monte Cristo â€œyou know full well that whenever we
part, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the
flowerâ€”the flower falls from the tree.â€

â€œMy lord,â€ replied HaydÃ©e, â€œI never will leave you, for I am sure I
could not exist without you.â€

â€œMy poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still
young.â€

â€œMy father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years
old, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.â€

â€œThen tell me, HaydÃ©e, do you believe you shall be able to accustom
yourself to our present mode of life?â€

â€œShall I see you?â€

â€œEvery day.â€

â€œThen what do you fear, my lord?â€

â€œYou might find it dull.â€

â€œNo, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your
coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have
enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty
pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering
mountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great
passions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, _ennui_
can find no place.â€

â€œYou are a worthy daughter of Epirus, HaydÃ©e, and your charming and
poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who
claim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see that
your youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial
solitude; and of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father,
I love you as a child.â€

â€œYou are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different from
the love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If you
were to die, I should die too.â€

The count, with a smile of profound tenderness, extended his hand, and
she carried it to her lips.

Monte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with
Morrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of
Pindar, â€œYouth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who,
after having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call
it his own.â€ The carriage was prepared according to orders, and
stepping lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.



 Chapter 50. The Morrel Family

In a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The
house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small
beds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate
the count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye
had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not
recognize the count.

The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to
avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,â€”an ornament that
had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the
place the appellation of _The Little Versailles_. It is needless to add
that there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with
kitchens and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and
attics. The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop,
two pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had
been purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make
of it a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the
garden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had
let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So
that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut
out from observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the
Faubourg St. Germain.

The breakfast-room was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the
furnishings were of blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and
green damask. There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a
music-room for Julie, who never played. The whole of the second story
was set apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sisterâ€™s
apartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a
billiard-room, where he received his friends. He was superintending the
grooming of his horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the
garden, when the countâ€™s carriage stopped at the gate.

Cocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired
whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel
would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.

â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo?â€ cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and
hastening to the carriage; â€œI should think we would see him. Ah, a
thousand thanks, count, for not having forgotten your promise.â€

And the young officer shook the countâ€™s hand so warmly, that Monte
Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw
that he had been expected with impatience, and was received with
pleasure.

â€œCome, come,â€ said Maximilian, â€œI will serve as your guide; such a man
as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the
garden plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers,
_la Presse_ and _les DÃ©bats_, within six steps of her; for wherever you
see Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four
yards and you will find M. Emmanuel, and â€˜reciprocally,â€™ as they say at
the Polytechnic School.â€

At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five-and-twenty,
dressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged in plucking the dead
leaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head. This was Julie, who
had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had
predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at
the sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh.

â€œDonâ€™t disturb yourself, Julie,â€ said he. â€œThe count has only been two
or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman
of the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.â€

â€œAh, monsieur,â€ returned Julie, â€œit is treason in my brother to bring
you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon,
Penelon!â€

An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade
in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid
of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of gray
mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his
bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who
had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics.

â€œI think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?â€ said he.

Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masterâ€™s daughter
â€œMademoiselle Julie,â€ and had never been able to change the name to
Madame Herbault.

â€œPenelon,â€ replied Julie, â€œgo and inform M. Emmanuel of this
gentlemanâ€™s visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.â€

Then, turning to Monte Cristo,â€”â€œI hope you will permit me to leave you
for a few minutes,â€ continued she; and without awaiting any reply,
disappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a
lateral alley.

30041m



â€œI am sorry to see,â€ observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, â€œthat I cause no
small disturbance in your house.â€

â€œLook there,â€ said Maximilian, laughing; â€œthere is her husband changing
his jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue
Meslay.â€

â€œYour family appears to be a very happy one,â€ said the count, as if
speaking to himself.

â€œOh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them
happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each
other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy
themselves as rich as Rothschild.â€

â€œFive-and-twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,â€ replied
Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to
Maximilianâ€™s heart like the voice of a father; â€œbut they will not be
content with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?â€

â€œHe was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my
poor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were
divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children.
Her husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his
noble probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation,
wished to possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he
had amassed 250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object.
Oh, I assure you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young
creatures, destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling
together, and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs
of their paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less
scrupulous people would have effected in two or three. Marseilles
resounded with their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel
came to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts.

â€œâ€˜Julie,â€™ said he to her, â€˜Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of
a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the
limits of our gains. Can you content yourself with the small fortune
which we shall possess for the future? Listen to me. Our house
transacts business to the amount of a million a year, from which we
derive an income of 40,000 francs. We can dispose of the business, if
we please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay,
in which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite
with his own, for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had better do.â€™

â€œâ€˜Emmanuel,â€™ returned my sister, â€˜the house of Morrel can only be
carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our
fatherâ€™s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?â€™

â€œâ€˜I thought so,â€™ replied Emmanuel; â€˜but I wished to have your advice.â€™

â€œâ€˜This is my counsel:â€”Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all
we have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.â€™

â€œThis was done instantly. It was three oâ€™clock; at a quarter past, a
merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit
of 15,000 francs.

â€œâ€˜Monsieur,â€™ said Emmanuel, â€˜have the goodness to address yourself to
M. Delaunay. We have quitted business.â€™

â€œâ€˜How long?â€™ inquired the astonished merchant.

30043m



â€œâ€˜A quarter of an hour,â€™ was the reply.

â€œAnd this is the reason, monsieur,â€ continued Maximilian, â€œof my sister
and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year.â€

Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the countâ€™s
heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and
coat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the
rank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the
little garden, he returned to the house.

A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the
air with their perfume, stood in the salon. Julie, suitably dressed,
and her hair arranged (she had accomplished this feat in less than ten
minutes), received the count on his entrance. The songs of the birds
were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose
acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains.
Everything in this charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to
the smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.

The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he
entered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that
he was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the
first salutations had been exchanged. The silence became almost painful
when, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie:

â€œMadame,â€ said he at length, â€œI pray you to excuse my emotion, which
must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here;
but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of
looking at yourself and your husband.â€

â€œWe are very happy, monsieur,â€ replied Julie; â€œbut we have also known
unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than
ourselves.â€

The countâ€™s features displayed an expression of the most intense
curiosity.

â€œOh, all this is a family history, as ChÃ¢teau-Renaud told you the other
day,â€ observed Maximilian. â€œThis humble picture would have but little
interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the
misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have
experienced bitter sorrows.â€

â€œAnd God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all
who are in affliction?â€ said Monte Cristo inquiringly.

â€œYes, count,â€ returned Julie, â€œwe may indeed say he has, for he has
done for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his
angels.â€

The countâ€™s cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an
excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth.

â€œThose born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every
wish,â€ said Emmanuel, â€œknow not what is the real happiness of life,
just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on
a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather.â€

Monte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness
of his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the
apartment with a slow step.

â€œOur magnificence makes you smile, count,â€ said Maximilian, who had
followed him with his eyes.

â€œNo, no,â€ returned Monte Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on
his heart to still its throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a
crystal cover, beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet
cushion. â€œI was wondering what could be the significance of this purse,
with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other.â€

â€œCount,â€ replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, â€œthose are our
most precious family treasures.â€

â€œThe stone seems very brilliant,â€ answered the count.

â€œOh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been
estimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in
this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now.â€

â€œThis I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,
madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo bowing. â€œPardon me, I had no intention of
committing an indiscretion.â€

â€œIndiscretion,â€”oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for
expatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action
this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh,
would we could relate it everywhere, and to everyone, so that the
emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence.â€

â€œAh, really,â€ said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.

â€œMonsieur,â€ returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and
respectfully kissing the silken purse, â€œthis has touched the hand of a
man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from
shame and disgrace,â€”a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor
children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear everyone
envying our happy lot. This letterâ€ (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a
letter from the purse and gave it to the count)â€”â€œthis letter was
written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution,
and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her
dowry.â€

Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable
feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our readers know) to
Julie, and signed â€œSinbad the Sailor.â€

â€œUnknown you say, is the man who rendered you this serviceâ€”unknown to
you?â€

â€œYes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,â€ continued
Maximilian. â€œWe have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor,
but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot
comprehendâ€”we have been guided by an invisible hand,â€”a hand as powerful
as that of an enchanter.â€

â€œOh,â€ cried Julie, â€œI have not lost all hope of some day kissing that
hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago,
Penelon was at Triesteâ€”Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the
garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardenerâ€”Penelon, when
he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point
of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who
called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this
letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity,
but he did not venture to address him.â€

â€œAn Englishman,â€ said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention
with which Julie looked at him. â€œAn Englishman you say?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Maximilian, â€œan Englishman, who represented himself as
the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It
was this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de
Morcerfâ€™s, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That
happened, as I told you, in 1829. For Godâ€™s sake, tell me, did you know
this Englishman?â€

â€œBut you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have
constantly denied having rendered you this service?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThen is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who,
grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself
had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?â€

â€œEverything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.â€

â€œWhat was his name?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œHe gave no other name,â€ answered Julie, looking earnestly at the
count, â€œthan that at the end of his letterâ€”â€˜Sinbad the Sailor.â€™â€

â€œWhich is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.â€

Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:

â€œTell me,â€ continued he, â€œwas he not about my height, perhaps a little
taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his
coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?â€

â€œOh, do you then know him?â€ cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.

â€œNo,â€ returned Monte Cristo â€œI only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who
was constantly doing actions of this kind.â€

â€œWithout revealing himself?â€

â€œHe was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of
gratitude.â€

â€œOh, Heaven,â€ exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, â€œin what did he
believe, then?â€

30047m



â€œHe did not credit it at the period which I knew him,â€ said Monte
Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julieâ€™s voice; â€œbut,
perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.â€

â€œAnd do you know this gentleman, monsieur?â€ inquired Emmanuel.

â€œOh, if you do know him,â€ cried Julie, â€œcan you tell us where he
isâ€”where we can find him? Maximilianâ€”Emmanuelâ€”if we do but discover
him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!â€

Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked
hastily up and down the room.

â€œIn the name of Heaven,â€ said Maximilian, â€œif you know anything of him,
tell us what it is.â€

â€œAlas,â€ cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, â€œif Lord
Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him
again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on
the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he
will never return.â€

â€œOh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,â€ said Julie, much affected; and
the young ladyâ€™s eyes swam with tears.

â€œMadame,â€ replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two
liquid pearls that trickled down Julieâ€™s cheeks, â€œhad Lord Wilmore seen
what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you
shed would reconcile him to mankind;â€ and he held out his hand to
Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the
count.

â€œBut,â€ continued she, â€œLord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must
have known someone, can we notâ€”â€”â€

â€œOh, it is useless to inquire,â€ returned the count; â€œperhaps, after
all, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no
secrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.â€

â€œAnd he told you nothing?â€

â€œNot a word.â€

â€œNothing that would lead you to suppose?â€

â€œNothing.â€

â€œAnd yet you spoke of him at once.â€

â€œAh, in such a case one supposesâ€”â€”â€

â€œSister, sister,â€ said Maximilian, coming to the countâ€™s aid, â€œmonsieur
is quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us,
â€˜It was no Englishman that thus saved us.â€™â€

Monte Cristo started. â€œWhat did your father tell you, M. Morrel?â€ said
he eagerly.

â€œMy father thought that this action had been miraculously performedâ€”he
believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh, it
was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself
believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my fatherâ€™s faith.
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friendâ€”a
friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near
approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with
supernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a
doubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, â€˜Maximilian, it
was Edmond DantÃ¨s!â€™â€

At these words the countâ€™s paleness, which had for some time been
increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watch
like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to
Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and
Maximilian,â€”â€œMadame,â€ said he, â€œI trust you will allow me to visit you
occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for
your welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have
thus yielded to my feelings;â€ and he hastily quitted the apartment.

â€œThis Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,â€ said Emmanuel.

â€œYes,â€ answered Maximilian, â€œbut I feel sure he has an excellent heart,
and that he likes us.â€

â€œHis voice went to my heart,â€ observed Julie; â€œand two or three times I
fancied that I had heard it before.â€



 Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe

About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©, and in the
rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood,
where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and
magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the
wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls
in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a
shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases
that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron
gate, that dated from the time of Louis XIII.

This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and
the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they
waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with
their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of
the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves
to the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted
courtyard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©, and to the garden
shut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine
kitchen-garden of about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a
line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the
kitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted
up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to
the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for
the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the
line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication
with the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ© itself, one of the most important
thoroughfares in the city of Paris.

In matters of speculation, however, though â€œman proposes,â€ yet â€œmoney
disposes.â€ From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost
in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high
price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his
bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging
to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it
that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the
interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented
himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners,
at a yearly rental of 500 francs.

And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden
had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to
eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers
and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic
enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a
height of six feet. True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but
that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the
strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left
no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that
circumstance.

Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted
kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons
had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its
being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from
the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the
ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters,
and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not
even the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house
the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall,
without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and
flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as
though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one
corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a
large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered
spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant
of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of
verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred
paces off.

Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the
boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly
justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool,
refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the
sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of
hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the
entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the
mansion. On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet
bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown
upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which
hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little
distance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the
iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means
of the openings in the planks,â€”the earnestness of her attitude and the
fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes,
proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter.

At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to
the street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man
appeared. He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but
his carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest
and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After
casting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he
was unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing
and securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the
barrier.

At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a
costume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a
hasty retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the
narrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe,
and observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close
to the planks, he exclaimed:

â€œDonâ€™t be alarmed, Valentineâ€”it is I!â€

Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as
she did so:

â€œAnd why do you come so late today? It is almost dinner-time, and I had
to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my
too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me
about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never
to get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made
me wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular
that at first I did not recognize you.â€

â€œDearest Valentine,â€ said the young man, â€œthe difference between our
respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love,
but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour
forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to
carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even
thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you
did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to
suppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my
being late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the
reason of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have
chosen a trade.â€

â€œA trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such
deep cause for uneasiness?â€

â€œHeaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than
life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about
it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously
alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about
here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief.
That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of
the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place
where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might
well create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently,
adopted the costume of my calling.â€

â€œWhat excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!â€

â€œNonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my
life by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually
screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger.â€

30053m



â€œI beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you
really mean.â€

â€œSimply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I
stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by
the proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucern. Think of
that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a
little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you.
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely
contain myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all priceâ€”as
a thing impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I
purchase all this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would
cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of
500 francs per annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to
fear. I am on my own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a
ladder against the wall, and to look over when I please, without having
any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious
character. I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of
my fond, faithful, and unalterable affection, whenever you visit your
favorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your pride to listen to
professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman, clad in a
blouse and cap.â€

A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of
Valentine, who almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though
some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart:

â€œAlas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons. We should
presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led
astray by our blind confidence in each otherâ€™s prudence.â€

â€œHow can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear
Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,
schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you
have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to
me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I
placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other
reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since,
by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from
the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?
You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay,
and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that
from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known
to change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you
wished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but
hoping that Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and
order events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties,
Valentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on
me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure
anything.â€

â€œAh, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and
which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask
myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my
mother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as
I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these
meetings, so fraught with danger to both.â€

â€œI will not admit that word,â€ returned the young man; â€œit is at once
cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than
myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time,
Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or
elsewhereâ€”have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this
enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateâ€”to be
close to you without really seeing youâ€”have I ever asked so much as to
touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a
trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a
murmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any
knight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what
I say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.â€

30055m



â€œIt is true,â€ said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian
to press his lips to them, â€œand you are a true and faithful friend; but
still you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian, for
you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an
opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to
bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend
but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father,
harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole
companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered
hand can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye
alone, although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness
for his poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either
as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my
only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed,
Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of
pity.â€

â€œValentine,â€ replied the young man, deeply affected, â€œI will not say
you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and
brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no
manner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart
beats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but
I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and
intensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render
them available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to
return home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable
and unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the
best; hope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while
reproaching me with selfishness, think a little what you have been to
meâ€”the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise
of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience
I have evinced?â€”none whatever. What granted me?â€”scarcely more. You tell
me of M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the
idea of being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other
sorrow in your heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life
and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your
service; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yoursâ€”that
were I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing
misery; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the
wife of another! Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel
conscious, as you do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as
mine, a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between
these iron bars, and said, â€˜Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and
believe that, living or dead, I am yoursâ€”yours only, and forever!â€™â€

The poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs
and tears. A rapid change took place in the young manâ€™s feelings.

â€œDearest, dearest Valentine,â€ exclaimed he, â€œforgive me if I have
offended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly
caused you pain.â€

â€œNo, Maximilian, I am not offended,â€ answered she, â€œbut do you not see
what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in
my fatherâ€™s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been
thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the
iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted,
day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for,
even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the
subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am
surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The
general remark is, â€˜Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a
character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do
on their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender
age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de
Villefort.â€™ The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from
utter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so
much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.â€

â€œHate you, sweet Valentine,â€ exclaimed the young man; â€œhow is it
possible for anyone to do that?â€

â€œAlas,â€ replied the weeping girl, â€œI am obliged to own that my
mother-in-lawâ€™s aversion to me arises from a very natural sourceâ€”her
overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.â€

â€œBut why should it?â€

â€œI do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into
our present conversation, I will just say this muchâ€”that her extreme
dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the
fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than
doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-MÃ©ran, whose sole heiress
I am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for
being so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of
this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fatherâ€™s love. God
knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me
a happy and affectionate home.â€

â€œPoor Valentine!â€

â€œI seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the same
time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the
restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too,
my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established
reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose
him; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a
word. Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not
attempt to resist my fatherâ€™s commands it is more on your account than
my own.â€

â€œBut why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,â€”why
picture so gloomy a future?â€

â€œBecause I judge it from the past.â€

â€œStill, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is
termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not
altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such
distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in
France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with
those of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself
with the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class;
and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging
as well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered,
and the memory of my late father is respected in our country,
Valentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the
city; I say our country, because you were born not far from
Marseilles.â€

â€œDonâ€™t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word
brings back my mother to my recollectionâ€”my angel mother, who died too
soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her
child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I
fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were
still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would
tell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.â€

â€œI fear, Valentine,â€ replied the lover, â€œthat were she living I should
never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been
too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on
me.â€

â€œNow it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,â€ cried Valentine; â€œbut there
is one thing I wish to know.â€

â€œAnd what is that?â€ inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine
hesitated.

â€œTell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers
dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?â€

â€œNot that I am aware of,â€ replied the young man, â€œunless, indeed, any
ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesâ€”your
father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine
was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any
other difference between them. But why do you ask?â€

â€œI will tell you,â€ replied the young girl, â€œfor it is but right you
should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of
the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting
with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there alsoâ€”you
recollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses
ran away with my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly
killed them? While the rest of the company were discussing the
approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper
to my grandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although
I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you
know you had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so
happy, and yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and
before so many people, that I really think I should have passed it
over, but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to
the cause of my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it
as firmly and as steadily as I could.â€

30059m



â€œDear Valentine!â€

â€œWell, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of
your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing,
I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by
the utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father
start, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must
have been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.â€

â€œâ€˜Morrel, Morrel,â€™ cried my father, â€˜stop a bit;â€™ then knitting his
brows into a deep frown, he added, â€˜surely this cannot be one of the
Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from
their violent Bonapartismâ€”I mean about the year 1815.â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ replied M. Danglars, â€˜I believe he is the son of the old
shipowner.â€™â€

â€œIndeed,â€ answered Maximilian; â€œand what did your father say then,
Valentine?â€

â€œOh, such a dreadful thing, that I donâ€™t dare to tell you.â€

â€œAlways tell me everything,â€ said Maximilian with a smile.

â€œâ€˜Ah,â€™ continued my father, still frowning, â€˜their idolized emperor
treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them â€˜food for
cannon,â€™ which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted
to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle
with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to
furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it
would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it
certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that
uncivilized country.â€™â€

â€œBrutal politics, I must confess.â€ said Maximilian; â€œbut donâ€™t attach
any serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was
not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. â€˜Why,â€™ said he, â€˜does not
the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of
improving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and
legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could
maintain, and using them to save better men?â€™ You see, my dear, that
for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much
to choose between the language of either party. But what did M.
Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?â€

â€œOh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to
himselfâ€”half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up
and took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation
of my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only
person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I
suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his
presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old
man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong
impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him
to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that
depreciating manner.â€

â€œThe name of M. Noirtier,â€ interposed Maximilian, â€œis celebrated
throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or
may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every
Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the
Bourbons.â€

â€œOh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most
strangeâ€”the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have
been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?
But to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to
question him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at
the newspaper I had been reading. â€˜What is the matter, dear
grandfather?â€™ said I, â€˜are you pleased?â€™ He gave me a sign in the
affirmative. â€˜With what my father said just now?â€™ He returned a sign in
the negative. â€˜Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?â€™ Another sign
in the negative. â€˜Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I
didnâ€™t dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion
of Honor?â€™ He signified assent; only think of the poor old manâ€™s being
so pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had
been made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim
on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I
love him for showing so much interest in you.â€

â€œHow singular,â€ murmured Maximilian; â€œyour father hates me, while your
grandfather, on the contraryâ€”What strange feelings are aroused by
politics.â€

â€œHush,â€ cried Valentine, suddenly; â€œsomeone is coming!â€ Maximilian
leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to pull up
in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in
weeding it.

â€œMademoiselle, mademoiselle!â€ exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.
â€œMadame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the
drawing-room.â€

â€œA visitor?â€ inquired Valentine, much agitated; â€œwho is it?â€

â€œSome grand personageâ€”a prince I believe they saidâ€”the Count of Monte
Cristo.â€

â€œI will come directly,â€ cried Valentine aloud.

The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man
on the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentineâ€™s _â€œI am comingâ€_
was the customary signal of farewell.

â€œNow, then,â€ said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, â€œI
would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of
Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort.â€



 Chapter 52. Toxicology

It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame
de Villefortâ€™s for the purpose of returning the procureurâ€™s visit, and
at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in
confusion.

Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count
was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly
to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great
personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come
to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of
gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance
remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent
speeches which made his mother say:

â€œOh, that naughty child! But I canâ€™t be severe with him, he is really
_so_ bright.â€

After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.

â€œMy husband dines with the chancellor,â€ replied the young lady; â€œhe has
just gone, and I am sure heâ€™ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the
pleasure of seeing you before he went.â€

Two visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him
with all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which
politeness admits and curiosity requires.

â€œWhat is your sister Valentine doing?â€ inquired Madame de Villefort of
Edward; â€œtell someone to bid her come here, that I may have the honor
of introducing her to the count.â€

â€œYou have a daughter, then, madame?â€ inquired the count; â€œvery young, I
presume?â€

â€œThe daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,â€ replied the
young wife, â€œa fine well-grown girl.â€

â€œBut melancholy,â€ interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out
of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded
perch, in order to make a plume for his hat.

Madame de Villefort merely cried, â€œBe still, Edward!â€ She then added,
â€œThis young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes
what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de
Villefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy
disposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of
her beauty. But what detains her? Go, Edward, and see.â€

â€œBecause they are looking for her where she is not to be found.â€

â€œAnd where are they looking for her?â€

â€œWith grandpapa Noirtier.â€

â€œAnd do you think she is not there?â€

â€œNo, no, no, no, no, she is not there,â€ replied Edward, singing his
words.

â€œAnd where is she, then? If you know, why donâ€™t you tell?â€

â€œShe is under the big chestnut-tree,â€ replied the spoiled brat, as he
gave, in spite of his motherâ€™s commands, live flies to the parrot,
which seemed keenly to relish such fare.

Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring, intending to direct
her waiting-maid to the spot where she would find Valentine, when the
young lady herself entered the apartment. She appeared much dejected;
and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the
traces of recent tears in her eyes.

Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented
to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and
graceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes,
and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her
mother. Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks
tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who
have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of
a swan.

She entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger
of whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish
awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that
redoubled the countâ€™s attention.

He rose to return the salutation.

â€œMademoiselle de Villefort, my step-daughter,â€ said Madame de Villefort
to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards
Valentine with her hand.

â€œAnd M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,â€ said
the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.

Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly
angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward;
but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy
complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy
and enthusiasm.

â€œBut, madame,â€ replied the count, continuing the conversation, and
looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, â€œhave I not
already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I
could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as
mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light
thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.â€

â€œI do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very
fond of society, and we very seldom go out,â€ said the young lady.

â€œThen it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself,
madame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world
is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in
Paris but very few days. No,â€”but, perhaps, you will permit me to call
to mindâ€”stay!â€

The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts.

â€œNoâ€”it was somewhereâ€”away from hereâ€”it wasâ€”I do not knowâ€”but it appears
that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some
religious _fÃªte_; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the
interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you,
madame, were under the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my aid,
madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?â€

â€œNo, indeed,â€ replied Madame de Villefort; â€œand yet it appears to me,
sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have
been imprinted on my memory.â€

â€œPerhaps the count saw us in Italy,â€ said Valentine timidly.

â€œYes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,â€ replied Monte Cristo;
â€œyou have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?â€

â€œYes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for
my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna,
Perugia, and Rome.â€

â€œAh, yesâ€”true, mademoiselle,â€ exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple
explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. â€œIt
was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the HÃ´tel des
Postes, when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and
her son; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you.â€

â€œI perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the HÃ´tel des Postes, and
the festival of which you speak,â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œbut in
vain do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really
do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you
before.â€

â€œIt is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,â€ observed
Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.

30065m



â€œBut I remember it perfectly,â€ interposed the darling Edward.

â€œI will assist your memory, madame,â€ continued the count; â€œthe day had
been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in
consequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of
the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.â€

â€œAnd I caught it, mamma, donâ€™t you remember?â€ interposed Edward, â€œand I
pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.â€

â€œYou, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while
you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you,
Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed
for a considerable time with somebody?â€

â€œYes, in truth, yes,â€ answered the young lady, turning very red, â€œI do
remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he
was a medical man, I think.â€

â€œPrecisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been
at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a
fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a
reputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame,
on different subjects; of Perugino, of Raphael, of manners, customs, of
the famous _aqua Tofana_, of which they had told you, I think you said,
that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret.â€

â€œYes, true,â€ replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, â€œI
remember now.â€

â€œI do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we
discoursed, madame,â€ continued the count with perfect calmness; â€œbut I
perfectly remember that, falling into the error which others had
entertained respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of
Mademoiselle de Villefort.â€

â€œYes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,â€ said Madame de
Villefort, â€œsince you had cured the sick.â€

â€œMoliÃ¨re or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was
precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself,
I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the
natural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you
understand.â€

At this moment the clock struck six.

â€œIt is six oâ€™clock,â€ said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated.
â€œValentine, will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his
dinner?â€

Valentine rose, and saluting the count, left the apartment without
speaking.

â€œOh, madame,â€ said the count, when Valentine had left the room, â€œwas it
on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?â€

â€œBy no means,â€ replied the young lady quickly; â€œbut this is the hour
when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his
pitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of
my husbandâ€™s father?â€

â€œYes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to meâ€”a paralysis, I think.â€

â€œAlas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone
is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and
flickering, like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me,
sir, for talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the
moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.â€

â€œNo, madame, I did not say as much as that,â€ replied the count with a
smile; â€œquite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having
determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of
following the example of King Mithridates.â€

â€œ_Mithridates, rex Ponticus_,â€ said the young scamp, as he tore some
beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, â€œthe individual who took
cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.â€

â€œEdward, you naughty boy,â€ exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching the
mutilated book from the urchinâ€™s grasp, â€œyou are positively past
bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join
your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtierâ€™s room.â€

â€œThe album,â€ said Edward sulkily.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€”the album!â€

â€œI want the album.â€

â€œHow dare you tear out the drawings?â€

â€œOh, it amuses me.â€

â€œGoâ€”go at once.â€

â€œI wonâ€™t go unless you give me the album,â€ said the boy, seating
himself doggedly in an armchair, according to his habit of never giving
way.

â€œTake it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,â€ said Madame de
Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door,
led by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.

â€œLet us see if she shuts the door after him,â€ he muttered.

Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the
count appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance
around the chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she
seated herself.

â€œAllow me to observe, madame,â€ said the count, with that kind tone he
could assume so well, â€œyou are really very severe with that dear clever
child.â€

â€œOh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,â€ replied Madame de
Villefort, with all a motherâ€™s real firmness.

â€œIt was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he
referred to King Mithridates,â€ continued the count, â€œand you
interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no
means neglected him, for your son is really advanced for his years.â€

â€œThe fact is, count,â€ answered the mother, agreeably flattered, â€œhe has
great aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one
fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment
to what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these
precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?â€

â€œI think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I
might not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrnaâ€”that is to
say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must
have lost my life.â€

â€œAnd your precautions were successful?â€

â€œCompletely so.â€

â€œYes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this
sort.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well
counterfeited; â€œI really did not remember.â€

â€œI inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,
on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that
the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same
aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the
South.â€

â€œAnd that is the case,â€ observed Monte Cristo. â€œI have seen Russians
devour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances
which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.â€

â€œAnd you really believe the result would be still more sure with us
than in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would
habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this
progressive absorption of poison?â€

â€œCertainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he
should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not
been accustomed.â€

â€œYes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for
instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?â€

â€œOh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be
made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,
brucineâ€”â€”â€

â€œBrucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?â€ inquired
Madame de Villefort.

â€œPrecisely, madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbut I perceive I have not
much to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such
learning is very rare among ladies.â€

â€œOh, I am aware of that,â€ said Madame de Villefort; â€œbut I have a
passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like
poetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but
go on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.â€

30069m



â€œWell,â€ replied Monte Cristo â€œsuppose, then, that this poison was
brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two
milligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days
you would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days,
increasing another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred
centigrammes; that is to say, a dose which you would support without
inconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for any other person
who had not taken the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the
end of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would
kill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise
than from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance
mingled with this water.â€

â€œDo you know any other counter-poisons?â€

â€œI do not.â€

â€œI have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,â€ said
Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, â€œand had always considered
it a fable.â€

â€œNo, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell
me, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance
query, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said
then, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had
occupied your mind.â€

â€œTrue, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and
mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples
frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life
of individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love
affair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a
Flamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.â€

â€œAnd the more, madame,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œas the Orientals do not
confine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his
poisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their
hands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an
offensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,
the other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea,
snake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in
their way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or
Greek, whom here you call â€˜good women,â€™ who do not know how, by means
of chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a
confessor.â€

â€œReally,â€ said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange
fire at this conversation.

â€œOh, yes, indeed, madame,â€ continued Monte Cristo, â€œthe secret dramas
of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potionâ€”begin
with paradise and end withâ€”hell. There are as many elixirs of every
kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral
nature of humanity; and I will say furtherâ€”the art of these chemists is
capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the
remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.â€

â€œBut, sir,â€ remarked the young woman, â€œthese Eastern societies, in the
midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as
fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can
easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and
Bassora of the _Thousand and One Nights_. The sultans and viziers who
rule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the
government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only
pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has
been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the
whole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of
idleness and _ennui_.â€

â€œBy no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,
disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are
police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,
behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible
manner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape
human justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning
stratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or
cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose
of, goes straight to the grocerâ€™s or druggistâ€™s, gives a false name,
which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under
the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or
six grammes of arsenicâ€”if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to
five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only
five or six times more easily traced;â€”then, when he has acquired his
specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of
arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which,
without rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the
entire neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables.
They fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the
entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a
hundred newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and
the murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or
druggists, come and say, â€˜It was I who sold the arsenic to the
gentleman;â€™ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they
will recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned,
interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or
steel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for
life. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry,
madame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.â€

â€œWhat would you have, sir?â€ said the lady, laughing; â€œwe do what we
can. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.â€

â€œNow,â€ replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, â€œshall I tell you
the cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by
what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see
persons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring,
and fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and
the spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the
murder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of
office, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools
believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way
from Franceâ€”go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome,
and you will see people passing by you in the streetsâ€”people erect,
smiling, and fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by
the skirt of his mantle, would say, â€˜That man was poisoned three weeks
ago; he will be a dead man in a month.â€™â€

â€œThen,â€ remarked Madame de Villefort, â€œthey have again discovered the
secret of the famous _aqua Tofana_ that they said was lost at Perugia.â€

â€œAh, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about
and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the
vulgar do not follow themâ€”that is all; but there is always the same
result. Poisons act particularly on some organ or anotherâ€”one on the
stomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the
poison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or
some other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,
by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were
not, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by
foolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in
favor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a
human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of
whom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my
acquaintance, the worthy AbbÃ© Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has
studied these national phenomena very profoundly.â€

â€œIt is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,â€ said the young lady,
motionless with attention. â€œI thought, I must confess, that these
tales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.â€

â€œYes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,
rewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead
society towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect
until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and
that is half the battle.â€

â€œSo,â€ added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,
â€œthe poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the RenÃ©es, the Ruggieris,
and later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so
misused by modern drama and romanceâ€”â€”â€

â€œWere objects of art, madame, and nothing more,â€ replied the count. â€œDo
you suppose that the real _savant_ addresses himself stupidly to the
mere individual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and
bounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term
them. Thus, for instance, the excellent AbbÃ© Adelmonte, of whom I spoke
just now, made in this way some marvellous experiments.â€

â€œReally?â€

â€œYes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full
of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he
selected the most simpleâ€”a cabbage, for instance. For three days he
watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the
cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In
the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its
wholesome appearance. It was only poisoned to the AbbÃ© Adelmonte. He
then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsâ€”for the AbbÃ©
Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as
fine as his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the
AbbÃ© Adelmonte took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage.
The rabbit died. What magistrate would find, or even venture to
insinuate, anything against this? What procureur has ever ventured to
draw up an accusation against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in
consequence of the rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs they have killed?â€”not
one. So, then, the rabbit dies, and justice takes no notice. This
rabbit dead, the AbbÃ© Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook
and thrown on the dunghill; on this dunghill is a hen, who, pecking
these intestines, is in her turn taken ill, and dies next day. At the
moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death, a vulture is
flying by (there are a good many vultures in Adelmonteâ€™s country); this
bird darts on the dead fowl, and carries it away to a rock, where it
dines off its prey. Three days afterwards, this poor vulture, which has
been very much indisposed since that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy
while flying aloft in the clouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond.
The pike, eels, and carp eat greedily always, as everybody knowsâ€”well,
they feast on the vulture. Now suppose that next day, one of these
eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at the fourth remove, is served up at
your table. Well, then, your guest will be poisoned at the fifth
remove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days, of pains in the
intestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus. The doctors open the
body and say with an air of profound learning, â€˜The subject has died of
a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!â€™â€

â€œBut,â€ remarked Madame de Villefort, â€œall these circumstances which you
link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the
vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the
fish-pond.â€

â€œAh, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the East,
one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.â€

Madame de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively.

â€œBut,â€ she exclaimed, suddenly, â€œarsenic is indelible, indestructible;
in whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of
the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient
quantity to cause death.â€

â€œPrecisely so,â€ cried Monte Cristoâ€”â€œprecisely so; and this is what I
said to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by
a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, â€˜My son,
the world was not made in a dayâ€”but in seven. Return on Sunday.â€™ On the
Sunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his
cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of
salts, having their basis in strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the
learned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of
disease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust;
yet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at
the rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the
vultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had
disappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar
indication in any organâ€”an excitement of the nervous systemâ€”that was
it; a case of cerebral congestionâ€”nothing more. The fowl had not been
poisonedâ€”she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among
fowls, I believe, but very common among men.â€

Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.

â€œIt is very fortunate,â€ she observed, â€œthat such substances could only
be prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning
each other.â€

â€œBy chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,â€ said Monte
Cristo carelessly.

â€œAnd then,â€ said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and
with effort, to get away from her thoughts, â€œhowever skilfully it is
prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it
does not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are
in cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hellâ€”that is the
point.â€

30075m



â€œReally, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure
mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of
Jean Jacques Rousseau,â€”you remember,â€”the mandarin who is killed five
hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Manâ€™s whole life
passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by
reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and
brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will
administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe
on which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of
which we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of ruleâ€”eccentric
or stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to
thirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings
excited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is
permissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,
then, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an
â€˜elimination;â€™ you merely and simply remove from your path the
individual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,
without the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a
punishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense
of the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no
groans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid
and compromising moment of accomplishing the act,â€”then one escapes the
clutch of the human law, which says, â€˜Do not disturb society!â€™ This is
the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern
climes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very
little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance.â€

â€œYet conscience remains,â€ remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated
voice, and with a stifled sigh.

â€œYes,â€ answered Monte Cristo â€œhappily, yes, conscience does remain; and
if it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring
exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a
thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons,
howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little
before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard III.,
for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the
putting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,
â€˜These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited
the vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their
juvenile propensitiesâ€”these two children are impediments in my way of
promoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they
(the children) would infallibly have caused.â€™ Thus was Lady Macbeth
served by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her
husband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is
a great virtue, a powerful motiveâ€”so powerful that it excuses a
multitude of things, even if, after Duncanâ€™s death, Lady Macbeth had
been at all pricked by her conscience.â€

Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and
horrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical
simplicity which was peculiar to him.

After a momentâ€™s silence, the lady inquired:

â€œDo you know, my dear count,â€ she said, â€œthat you are a very terrible
reasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered
medium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through
alembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the
elixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost
instantaneouslyâ€”â€”â€

30077m



â€œOh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; _one_ drop of that
elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would
have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have
produced most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his
respiration, and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was;
ten would have destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched
him from those phials which he so imprudently touched?â€

â€œIs it then so terrible a poison?â€

â€œOh, no! In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does not
exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons,
which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.â€

â€œWhat, then, is it?â€

â€œA skilful preparation of my friendâ€™s the worthy AbbÃ© Adelmonte, who
taught me the use of it.â€

â€œOh,â€ observed Madame de Villefort, â€œit must be an admirable
anti-spasmodic.â€

â€œPerfect, madame, as you have seen,â€ replied the count; â€œand I
frequently make use of itâ€”with all possible prudence though, be it
observed,â€ he added with a smile of intelligence.

â€œMost assuredly,â€ responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. â€œAs
for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require a
Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and
tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of
suffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in
France, and your abbÃ© is not probably disposed to make a journey to
Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Plancheâ€™s
anti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffmanâ€™s drops are among my favorite
remedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they
are compounded doubly strong.â€

Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to
him, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur
who thoroughly appreciated their composition.

â€œThey are indeed exquisite,â€ he said; â€œbut as they are necessarily
submitted to the process of deglutitionâ€”a function which it is
frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishâ€”I prefer my
own specific.â€

â€œUndoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen
produced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as
to ask it of you.â€

â€œBut I,â€ said Monte Cristo, rising as he spokeâ€”â€œI am gallant enough to
offer it you.â€

30079m



â€œHow kind you are.â€

â€œOnly remember one thingâ€”a small dose is a remedy, a large one is
poison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will
inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured
into a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its
flavor. But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were
prescribing for you.â€

The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of
Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.

â€œIf I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,
count, instead of only for the second,â€ said Madame de Villefort; â€œif I
had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the
happiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on
detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first
refusal.â€

â€œA thousand thanks, madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo â€œbut I have an
engagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the
AcadÃ©mie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your
grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.â€

â€œAdieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.â€

â€œAh, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hourâ€™s conversation
I have had with you, which is indeed impossible.â€

Monte Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained
immersed in thought.

â€œHe is a very strange man,â€ she said, â€œand in my opinion is himself the
Adelmonte he talks about.â€

As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations.

â€œGood,â€ said he, as he went away; â€œthis is a fruitful soil, and I feel
certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.â€

Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription
requested.



 Chapter 53. Robert le Diable

The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as
there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction
at the AcadÃ©mie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe
illness, made his reappearance in the character of _Bertram_, and, as
usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite
composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his
orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at
least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his
acquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus
box. ChÃ¢teau-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as
a journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened
that on this particular night the ministerâ€™s box was placed at the
disposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who
again, upon his rejection of it by MercÃ©dÃ¨s, sent it to Danglars, with
an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining
the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their
accepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too
much pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the
presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the
wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying
a kingâ€™s ransom in his waistcoat pocket.

Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a
ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his
parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not
permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore,
despatched a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being
wholly impossible for her to go alone with EugÃ©nie to the opera.

There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction
would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone
without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her
motherâ€™s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice
and ill-nature. One must take the world as one finds it.

30083m



The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of
the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until
after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is
generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that
part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in
observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of
opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation.

â€œSurely,â€ said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened,
â€œthat must be the Countess Gâ€”â€”.â€

â€œAnd who is the Countess Gâ€”â€”?â€ inquired ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œWhat a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick
a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who
the Countess Gâ€”â€” was.â€

â€œAh, to be sure,â€ replied ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œthe lovely Venetian, is it
not?â€

â€œHerself.â€ At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned
his salutation with a smile.

â€œYou know her, it seems?â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œFranz introduced me to her at Rome,â€ replied Albert.

â€œWell, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you
in Rome?â€

â€œWith pleasure.â€

There was a cry of â€œShut up!â€ from the audience. This manifestation on
the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the
music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who
continued their conversation.

â€œThe countess was present at the races in the Champ-de-Mars,â€ said
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œToday?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?â€

â€œOh, merely a paltry fifty louis.â€

â€œAnd who was the winner?â€

â€œNautilus. I staked on him.â€

â€œBut there were three races, were there not?â€

â€œYes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Clubâ€”a gold cup, you
knowâ€”and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.â€

â€œWhat was it?â€

â€œOh, shut up!â€ again interposed some of the audience.

â€œWhy, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.â€

â€œIs that possible?â€

â€œTrue as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the
name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last
moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,
presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff
at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riderâ€™s pockets, to
make him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare,
against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.â€

â€œAnd was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey
belonged?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œYou say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?â€

â€œExactly; that was the title.â€

â€œThen,â€ answered Albert, â€œI am better informed than you are, and know
who the owner of that horse was.â€

â€œShut up, there!â€ cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and
manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility
that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate
was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized
the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one
person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they
deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the
challenge, the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and
affected to busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of
the ministerâ€™s box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her
daughter, entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted
them to their seats.

â€œHa, ha,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œhere come some friends of yours,
viscount! What are you looking at there? donâ€™t you see they are trying
to catch your eye?â€

Albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan
from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie, she scarcely vouchsafed
to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of
the stage.

â€œI tell you what, my dear fellow,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œI cannot
imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle
Danglarsâ€”that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat
inferior rank, which by the way I donâ€™t think you care very much about.
Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!â€

â€œHandsome, certainly,â€ replied Albert, â€œbut not to my taste, which I
confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.â€

â€œAh, well,â€ exclaimed ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, who because he had seen his
thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of
paternal air with his more youthful friend, â€œyou young people are never
satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you
a bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not
content.â€

â€œNo, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked
something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this
chase-loving Diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a
sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of ActÃ¦on.â€

And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to
comprehend the justness of Morcerfâ€™s remark. She was beautiful, but her
beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious
taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat
rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by
well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost
habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of
firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler
attributes of her sexâ€”her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have
chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found
fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered
still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips,
contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which
completed the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his
taste, was a dark mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of
nature generally are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the
effect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that
characterized her countenance.

The rest of Mademoiselle EugÃ©nieâ€™s person was in perfect keeping with
the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute.

As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was
the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her
beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young
a person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote
poetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to
be entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance,
assisted by a schoolfellow,â€”a young woman without fortune whose talent
promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored
that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the
principal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in
the cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of
wealth and independence. But this counsel effectually decided
Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public
with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this
principle, the bankerâ€™s daughter, though perfectly willing to allow
Mademoiselle Louise dâ€™Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa)
to practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen
in her company. Still, though not actually received at the HÃ´tel
Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated
with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a
governess.

The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame
Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the
accustomed half-hourâ€™s interval allowed between the acts, and the
audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to
pay and receive visits in their respective boxes.

Morcerf and ChÃ¢teau-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves
of this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that
this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his
impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her
daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.
Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of
the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her
mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the
Countess Gâ€”â€”, and where Morcerf had just made his appearance.

30087m



â€œSo we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?â€ cried the countess,
extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old
acquaintance; â€œit was really very good of you to recognize me so
quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me.â€

â€œBe assured,â€ replied Albert, â€œthat if I had been aware of your arrival
in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects to
you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in
France, and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of
the races in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.â€

ChÃ¢teau-Renaud bowed to the countess.

â€œSo you were at the races, baron?â€ inquired the countess eagerly.

â€œYes, madame.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ pursued Madame Gâ€”â€” with considerable animation, â€œyou can
probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?â€

â€œI am sorry to say I cannot,â€ replied the baron; â€œand I was just asking
the same question of Albert.â€

â€œAre you very anxious to know, countess?â€ asked Albert.

â€œTo know what?â€

â€œThe name of the owner of the winning horse?â€

â€œExcessively; only imagineâ€”but do tell me, viscount, whether you really
are acquainted with it or no?â€

â€œI beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,
were you not? You said, â€˜only imagine,â€™â€”and then paused. Pray
continue.â€

â€œWell, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid
roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a
pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their
success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were
at stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the
winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with
joy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I
met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I
concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse
must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments,
I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and
rider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written
these wordsâ€”â€˜From Lord Ruthven to Countess Gâ€”â€”.â€™â€

â€œPrecisely; I was sure of it,â€ said Morcerf.

â€œSure of what?â€

â€œThat the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.â€

â€œWhat Lord Ruthven do you mean?â€

â€œWhy, our Lord Ruthvenâ€”the Vampire of the Salle Argentina!â€

â€œIs it possible?â€ exclaimed the countess; â€œis he here in Paris?â€

â€œTo be sure,â€”why not?â€

â€œAnd you visit him?â€”meet him at your own house and elsewhere?â€

â€œI assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud
has also the honor of his acquaintance.â€

â€œBut why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club
prize?â€

â€œWas not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?â€

â€œWhat of that?â€

â€œWhy, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I
was made prisoner?â€

â€œOh, yes.â€

â€œAnd from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a
manner?â€

â€œTo be sure, I remember it all now.â€

â€œHe called himself Vampa. You see, itâ€™s evident where the count got the
name.â€

â€œBut what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?â€

â€œIn the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you
may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a
countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success.â€

â€œI trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish
remarks we used to make about him?â€

â€œI should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his
presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthvenâ€”â€”â€

â€œOh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.â€

â€œDoes his action appear like that of an enemy?â€

â€œNo; certainly not.â€

â€œWell, thenâ€”â€”â€

â€œAnd so he is in Paris?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd what effect does he produce?â€

â€œWhy,â€ said Albert, â€œhe was talked about for a week; then the
coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of
Mademoiselle Marsâ€™s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.â€

â€œMy good fellow,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œthe count is your friend and
you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you,
countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by
the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon
myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding
act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth
32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
preservation of Madame de Villefortâ€™s life; now it seems that he has
carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain,
in spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest
at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a
month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,
after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.â€

â€œPerhaps you are right,â€ said Morcerf; â€œmeanwhile, who is in the
Russian ambassadorâ€™s box?â€

â€œWhich box do you mean?â€ asked the countess.

â€œThe one between the pillars on the first tierâ€”it seems to have been
fitted up entirely afresh.â€

â€œDid you observe anyone during the first act?â€ asked ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œWhere?â€

â€œIn that box.â€

â€œNo,â€ replied the countess, â€œit was certainly empty during the first
act;â€ then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she
said, â€œAnd so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte
Cristo that gained the prize?â€

â€œI am sure of it.â€

â€œAnd who afterwards sent the cup to me?â€

â€œUndoubtedly.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t know him,â€ said the countess; â€œI have a great mind to
return it.â€

â€œDo no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed
of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is
his way, and you must take him as you find him.â€

At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain
for the second act. Albert rose to return to his place.

â€œShall I see you again?â€ asked the countess.

â€œAt the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and
inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?â€

â€œPray take notice,â€ said the countess, â€œthat my present residence is 22
Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday
evening. So now, you are both forewarned.â€

The young men bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls,
they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and
directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian
ambassador. A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in
deep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed
after the Eastern style. The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the
rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her.

â€œHullo,â€ said Albert; â€œit is Monte Cristo and his Greek!â€

The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and HaydÃ©e. In a
few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole
house, and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize
her magnificent diamonds.

The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesâ€”one deep
whisperâ€”intimating that some great and universally interesting event
had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were occupied with the young and
beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most
extraordinary spectacle.

Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated
her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the
second act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would
permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the
close of the act he therefore went to the baroness.

Having bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand to Debray. By the
baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while EugÃ©nie received him
with her accustomed coldness.

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ said Debray, â€œyou have come in the nick of time.
There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count;
she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and
parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no
disciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of
getting out of the scrape, I said, â€˜Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole
history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingersâ€™ ends;â€™ whereupon
the baroness signified her desire to see you.â€

â€œIs it not almost incredible,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œthat a person
having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,
should possess so little information?â€

â€œLet me assure you, madame,â€ said Lucien, â€œthat had I really the sum
you mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in
troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte
Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich
as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so
pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own
part, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.â€

30093m



â€œI am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth
32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000
francs each.â€

â€œHe seems to have a mania for diamonds,â€ said Morcerf, smiling, â€œand I
verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for
the sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint
stones.â€

â€œPerhaps he has discovered some mine,â€ said Madame Danglars. â€œI suppose
you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baronâ€™s banking
establishment?â€

â€œI was not aware of it,â€ replied Albert, â€œbut I can readily believe
it.â€

â€œAnd, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only
staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six
millions.

â€œHe must be the Shah of Persia, travelling _incog_.â€

â€œHave you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?â€
inquired EugÃ©nie.

â€œI really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms
of another as yourself,â€ responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his
eye. â€œA most lovely creature, upon my soul!â€ was his verdict.

â€œWho is this young person, M. de Morcerf?â€ inquired EugÃ©nie; â€œdoes
anybody know?â€

â€œMademoiselle,â€ said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, â€œI can
give you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most
points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now
conversingâ€”the young woman is a Greek.â€

â€œSo I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that,
everyone here is as well-informed as yourself.â€

â€œI am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_,â€ replied
Morcerf, â€œbut I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing
further to communicateâ€”yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely,
that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting
with the count, I heard the sound of a guzlaâ€”it is impossible that it
could have been touched by any other finger than her own.â€

â€œThen your count entertains visitors, does he?â€ asked Madame Danglars.

â€œIndeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.â€

â€œI must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,
or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in
return.â€

â€œWhat,â€ said Debray, laughing; â€œdo you really mean you would go to his
house?â€

â€œWhy not? my husband could accompany me.â€

â€œBut do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?â€

â€œYou have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,â€ said the
baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.

â€œNo, no!â€ exclaimed Debray; â€œthat girl is not his wife: he told us
himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling
us so at your breakfast?â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said the baroness, â€œif slave she be, she has all the air
and manner of a princess.â€

â€œOf the â€˜Arabian Nightsâ€™.â€

â€œIf you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes
a princess. Why, diamondsâ€”and she is covered with them.â€

â€œTo me she seems overloaded,â€ observed EugÃ©nie; â€œshe would look far
better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely
formed throat and wrists.â€

â€œSee how the artist peeps out!â€ exclaimed Madame Danglars. â€œMy poor
EugÃ©nie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.â€

â€œI admire all that is beautiful,â€ returned the young lady.

â€œWhat do you think of the count?â€ inquired Debray; â€œhe is not much
amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.â€

â€œThe count,â€ repeated EugÃ©nie, as though it had not occurred to her to
observe him sooner; â€œthe count?â€”oh, he is so dreadfully pale.â€

â€œI quite agree with you,â€ said Morcerf; â€œand the secret of that very
pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess Gâ€”â€” insists upon it
that he is a vampire.â€

â€œThen the Countess Gâ€”â€” has returned to Paris, has she?â€ inquired the
baroness.

â€œIs that she, mamma?â€ asked EugÃ©nie; â€œalmost opposite to us, with that
profusion of beautiful light hair?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œthat is she. Shall I tell you what you
ought to do, Morcerf?â€

â€œCommand me, madame.â€

â€œWell, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ asked EugÃ©nie.

â€œWhat for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no
desire to meet him?â€

â€œNone whatever,â€ replied EugÃ©nie.

â€œStrange child,â€ murmured the baroness.

â€œHe will very probably come of his own accord,â€ said Morcerf. â€œThere;
do you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.â€

The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful
manner.

â€œWell,â€ said Morcerf, â€œI may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself
away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any
means of speaking to him.â€

â€œGo straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.â€

â€œBut I have never been presented.â€

â€œPresented to whom?â€

â€œTo the beautiful Greek.â€

â€œYou say she is only a slave?â€

â€œWhile you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I
hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.â€

â€œThat is possibleâ€”go.â€

â€œI am going,â€ said Albert, as he made his parting bow.

Just as he was passing the countâ€™s box, the door opened, and Monte
Cristo came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in
the lobby, the count took Albertâ€™s arm. Carefully closing the box door,
Ali placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled
round the Nubian.

â€œUpon my word,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œParis is a strange city, and the
Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected
around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one
might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can
promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in
Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that
way.â€

â€œThat shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste
their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as
far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is
merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantâ€”you, who are
at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.â€

â€œReally? and what has procured me so flattering a distinction?â€

â€œWhat? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand
louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the
name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not
larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy
of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the
first handsome woman you think of!â€

â€œAnd who has filled your head with all this nonsense?â€

â€œWhy, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the
by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by
others; secondly, I learned it from Beauchampâ€™s journal; and thirdly,
from my own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call
your horse Vampa?â€

â€œThat was an oversight, certainly,â€ replied the count; â€œbut tell me,
does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking
for him, but without success.â€

â€œHe will be here tonight.â€

â€œIn what part of the house?â€

â€œIn the baronessâ€™s box, I believe.â€

â€œThat charming young woman with her is her daughter?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI congratulate you.â€

Morcerf smiled.

â€œWe will discuss that subject at length some future time,â€ said he.
â€œBut what do you think of the music?â€

â€œWhat music?â€

â€œWhy, the music you have been listening to.â€

â€œOh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by
featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.â€

â€œFrom which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure
enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of
paradise?â€

30097m



â€œYou are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more
exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I
go to sleep.â€

â€œThen sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what
else was opera invented for?â€

â€œNo, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner
I speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain
preparationâ€”â€”â€

â€œI knowâ€”the famous hashish!â€

â€œPrecisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with
music come and sup with me.â€

â€œI have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,â€ said
Morcerf.

â€œDo you mean at Rome?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œAh, then, I suppose you heard HaydÃ©eâ€™s guzla; the poor exile
frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her
native land.â€

Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into
a silent reverie.

The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain.

â€œYou will excuse my leaving you,â€ said the count, turning in the
direction of his box.

â€œWhat? Are you going?â€

â€œPray, say everything that is kind to Countess Gâ€”â€” on the part of her
friend the vampire.â€

â€œAnd what message shall I convey to the baroness!â€

â€œThat, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my
respects in the course of the evening.â€

The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,
according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame
Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either
interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence,
therefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in
which he had just seated himself.

The quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming; and a slight
though meaning smile passed over his lips. HaydÃ©e, whose soul seemed
centred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated natures,
delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear.

30099m



The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julia, and
Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the
Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella,
taking his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic
strides, the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and
mantle. After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured
forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon.

The count left his box, and a moment later was saluting the Baronne
Danglars, who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and
surprise.

â€œYou are welcome, count!â€ she exclaimed, as he entered. â€œI have been
most anxious to see you, that I might repeat orally the thanks writing
can so ill express.â€

â€œSurely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your
remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.â€

â€œBut it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day
after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame
de Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity
restored to me.â€

30101m



â€œThis time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my
Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.â€

â€œWas it Ali,â€ asked the Count of Morcerf, â€œwho rescued my son from the
hands of bandits?â€

â€œNo, count,â€ replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by
the general; â€œin this instance I may fairly and freely accept your
thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your
debtâ€”if indeed there existed oneâ€”and I feel almost mortified to find
you still reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to
honor me with an introduction to your daughter?â€

â€œOh, you are no strangerâ€”at least not by name,â€ replied Madame
Danglars, â€œand the last two or three days we have really talked of
nothing but you. EugÃ©nie,â€ continued the baroness, turning towards her
daughter, â€œthis is the Count of Monte Cristo.â€

The count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly.

â€œYou have a charming young person with you tonight, count,â€ said
EugÃ©nie. â€œIs she your daughter?â€

â€œNo, mademoiselle,â€ said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. â€œShe is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my
care.â€

â€œAnd what is her name?â€

â€œHaydÃ©e,â€ replied Monte Cristo.

â€œA Greek?â€ murmured the Count of Morcerf.

â€œYes, indeed, count,â€ said Madame Danglars; â€œand tell me, did you ever
see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly
served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?â€

â€œDid I hear rightly, monsieur,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œthat you served at
Yanina?â€

â€œI was inspector-general of the pashaâ€™s troops,â€ replied Morcerf; â€œand
it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality
of the illustrious Albanese chief.â€

â€œBut look!â€ exclaimed Madame Danglars.

â€œWhere?â€ stammered Morcerf.

â€œThere,â€ said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and
leaning with him over the front of the box, just as HaydÃ©e, whose eyes
were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,
perceived his pale features close to Morcerfâ€™s face. It was as if the
young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to
assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint
cry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people
about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door.

â€œWhy, count,â€ exclaimed EugÃ©nie, â€œwhat has happened to your ward? she
seems to have been taken suddenly ill.

â€œVery probably,â€ answered the count. â€œBut do not be alarmed on her
account. HaydÃ©eâ€™s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is
peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersâ€”nay, there are some
which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,â€
continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, â€œI have
an infallible remedy.â€

So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a
parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame
Danglarsâ€™ box. Upon his return to HaydÃ©e he found her still very pale.
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist
and icy cold.

â€œWho was it you were talking with over there?â€ she asked.

â€œWith the Count of Morcerf,â€ answered Monte Cristo. â€œHe tells me he
served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.â€

â€œWretch!â€ exclaimed HaydÃ©e, her eyes flashing with rage; â€œhe sold my
father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his
treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?â€

â€œSomething of this I heard in Epirus,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œbut the
particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my
child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.â€

â€œYes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain
long near that dreadful man.â€

So saying, HaydÃ©e arose, and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white
cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box
at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act.

â€œDo you observe,â€ said the Countess Gâ€”â€” to Albert, who had returned to
her side, â€œthat man does nothing like other people; he listens most
devoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_, and when the fourth
begins, takes his departure.â€



 Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks

Some days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of
Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, which had already
assumed that palace-like appearance which the countâ€™s princely fortune
enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. He came to
renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to
the count through the medium of a letter, signed â€œBaronne Danglars,
_nÃ©e_ Hermine de Servieux.â€

Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friendâ€™s
conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the
countâ€™s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. He was
convinced that Lucienâ€™s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity,
the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la ChaussÃ©e
dâ€™Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able personally to
examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a
man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera
with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of
money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to
give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this
incomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that
there could be the slightest connection between Lucienâ€™s visit and the
curiosity of the baroness.

â€œYou are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?â€ the count
inquired of Albert de Morcerf.

â€œYes, count, you know what I told you?â€

â€œAll remains the same, then, in that quarter?â€

â€œIt is more than ever a settled thing,â€ said Lucien,â€”and, considering
that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,
he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed
cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and
the pictures.

â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œI did not expect that the affair would be so
promptly concluded.â€

â€œOh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are
forgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and when,
again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at the
progress they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M.
Danglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M.
Danglars in the commissariat department. It was there that my father,
ruined by the revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any
patrimony, both laid the foundations of their different fortunes.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œI think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit
which I paid him; and,â€ continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien,
who was turning over the leaves of an album, â€œMademoiselle EugÃ©nie is
prettyâ€”I think I remember that to be her name.â€

â€œVery pretty, or rather, very beautiful,â€ replied Albert, â€œbut of that
style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.â€

â€œYou speak as if you were already her husband.â€

â€œAh,â€ returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien
was doing.

â€œReally,â€ said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, â€œyou do not appear to
me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.â€

â€œMademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œand that
frightens me.â€

â€œBah,â€ exclaimed Monte Cristo, â€œthatâ€™s a fine reason to give. Are you
not rich yourself?â€

â€œMy fatherâ€™s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give
me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.â€

â€œThat, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris
especially,â€ said the count; â€œbut everything does not depend on wealth,
and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high
station in society. Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent;
and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see
the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin;
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can
shine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a
most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.â€

Albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.

â€œThere is still something else,â€ said he.

â€œI confess,â€ observed Monte Cristo, â€œthat I have some difficulty in
comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and
beautiful.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Morcerf, â€œthis repugnance, if repugnance it may be called,
is not all on my side.â€

â€œWhence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the
marriage.â€

â€œIt is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating
judgment, and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account
for it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the
Danglars.â€

30107m



â€œAh,â€ said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, â€œthat may be easily
explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement
itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with
one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.â€

â€œI do not know if that is her reason,â€ said Albert, â€œbut one thing I do
know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite
miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to
talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of
indispositionâ€”â€”â€

â€œReal?â€ interrupted the count, smiling.

â€œOh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,â€”at any rate they postponed
the matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet
twenty-one, and EugÃ©nie is only seventeen; but the two months expire
next week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my
mind is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!â€

â€œWell, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from
being so?â€

â€œOh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not
marry Mademoiselle Danglars.â€

â€œMarry her then,â€ said the count, with a significant shrug of the
shoulders.

â€œYes,â€ replied Morcerf, â€œbut that will plunge my mother into positive
grief.â€

â€œThen do not marry her,â€ said the count.

â€œWell, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing to
be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible
extricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give
pain to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.â€

Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.

â€œAh,â€ said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at
the farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right
hand and an account book in his left, â€œwhat are you doing there? Are
you making a sketch after Poussin?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ was the tranquil response; â€œI am too fond of art to attempt
anything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in arithmetic.â€

â€œIn arithmetic?â€

â€œYes; I am calculatingâ€”by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns
youâ€”I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the
last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three
days, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must
have made 300,000 livres.â€

â€œThat is not his biggest scoop,â€ said Morcerf; â€œdid he not make a
million in Spaniards this last year?â€

â€œMy dear fellow,â€ said Lucien, â€œhere is the Count of Monte Cristo, who
will say to you, as the Italians do,â€”

      â€œâ€˜Denaro e santitÃ ,

      MetÃ  della metÃ .â€™9


â€œWhen they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say
nothing.â€

â€œBut you were speaking of Haitians?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œAh, Haitians,â€”that is quite another thing! Haitians are the _Ã©cartÃ©_
of French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be
enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always
come back to _Ã©cartÃ©_â€”it is not only a game, it is a _hors-dâ€™Å“uvre_! M.
Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but
waited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of
gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.â€

â€œAnd what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?â€ asked Monte
Cristo. â€œI am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing
intrigues.â€

â€œBecause,â€ said Albert, laughing, â€œone piece of news follows another,
and there is often great dissimilarity between them.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the count, â€œI see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at
gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.â€

â€œIt is not he who plays!â€ exclaimed Lucien; â€œit is Madame Danglars; she
is indeed daring.â€

â€œBut you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how little
dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the
fountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,â€ said Morcerf, with a
smile.

â€œHow can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?â€ asked Lucien;
â€œyou know the character of the baronessâ€”no one has any influence with
her, and she does precisely what she pleases.â€

â€œAh, if I were in your placeâ€”â€”â€ said Albert.

â€œWell?â€

â€œI would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future
son-in-law.â€

â€œHow would you set about it?â€

â€œAh, that would be easy enoughâ€”I would give her a lesson.â€

â€œA lesson?â€

â€œYes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority
great on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but
the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to lose a
hundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.â€

â€œI do not understand,â€ stammered Lucien.

â€œIt is very clear, notwithstanding,â€ replied the young man, with an
artlessness wholly free from affectation; â€œtell her some fine morning
an unheard-of piece of intelligenceâ€”some telegraphic despatch, of which
you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV. was seen
yesterday at Gabrielleâ€™s. That would boom the market; she will buy
heavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the
following day, in his gazette, â€˜The report circulated by some usually
well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielleâ€™s
house, is totally without foundation. We can positively assert that his
majesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.â€™â€

Lucien half smiled. Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had
not lost one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had
even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary.
This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien
to shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in
taking leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he
answered, â€œWillingly, count; I accept.â€ The count returned to young
Morcerf.

â€œDo you not think, on reflection,â€ said he to him, â€œthat you have done
wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of M.
Debray?â€

â€œMy dear count,â€ said Morcerf, â€œI beg of you not to apply that title so
prematurely.â€

â€œNow, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very
much averse to this marriage?â€

â€œSo much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole
life.â€

â€œThen,â€ said the count, â€œI am emboldened to speak openly to you. M.
Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with
politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
enabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of
dinners and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be
beforehand with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting
M. and Madame Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to my
country-house at Auteuil. If I were to invite you and the Count and
Countess of Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of
being a matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look
upon the affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the
honor to bring his daughter. In that case your mother would hold me in
aversion, and I do not at all wish that; on the contrary, I desire to
stand high in her esteem.â€

â€œIndeed, count,â€ said Morcerf, â€œI thank you sincerely for having used
so much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which
you propose. You say you desire my motherâ€™s good opinion; I assure you
it is already yours to a very unusual extent.â€

30111m



â€œDo you think so?â€ said Monte Cristo, with interest.

â€œOh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the
other day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could
know of this attention on your partâ€”and I will venture to tell herâ€”I am
sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father
will be equally angry.â€ The count laughed.

â€œWell,â€ said he to Morcerf, â€œbut I think your father will not be the
only angry one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very
ill-mannered person. They know that I am intimate with youâ€”that you
are, in fact; one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintancesâ€”and they
will not find you at my house; they will certainly ask me why I did not
invite you. Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement
which shall have a semblance of probability, and communicate the fact
to me by a line in writing. You know that with bankers nothing but a
written document will be valid.â€

â€œI will do better than that,â€ said Albert; â€œmy mother is wishing to go
to the sea-sideâ€”what day is fixed for your dinner?â€

â€œSaturday.â€

â€œThis is Tuesdayâ€”well, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day after we
shall be at TrÃ©port. Really, count, you have a delightful way of
setting people at their ease.â€

â€œIndeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do what
will be agreeable to you, that is all.â€

â€œWhen shall you send your invitations?â€

â€œThis very day.â€

â€œWell, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my
mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow. I have not seen you,
consequently I know nothing of your dinner.â€

â€œHow foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen
you at my house?â€

â€œAh, true.â€

â€œFix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any
ceremony, when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for
you to accept, as you were going to TrÃ©port.â€

â€œWell, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my mother
before tomorrow?â€

â€œBefore tomorrow?â€”that will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides,
I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.â€

â€œWell, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but, if
you accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.â€

â€œWhat must I do to attain such sublimity?â€

â€œYou are today free as airâ€”come and dine with me; we shall be a small
partyâ€”only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely seen my
mother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely.
She is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist
another like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure
you, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As
to my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines
with the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who
have seen the whole world, will relate your adventuresâ€”you shall tell
us the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night
at the Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a
princess. We will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation,
and my mother will thank you.â€

â€œA thousand thanks,â€ said the count, â€œyour invitation is most gracious,
and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it. I am
not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most
important engagement.â€

â€œAh, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an
invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require
the proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but
I am quite as incredulous as he is.â€

â€œI am going to give you a proof,â€ replied the count, and he rang the
bell.

â€œHumph,â€ said Morcerf, â€œthis is the second time you have refused to
dine with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.â€

Monte Cristo started. â€œOh, you do not mean that,â€ said he; â€œbesides,
here comes the confirmation of my assertion.â€

Baptistin entered, and remained standing at the door.

â€œI had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?â€

â€œIndeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer
for it.â€

â€œAt all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner.â€

â€œProbably not.â€

â€œWell, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I
called you into my laboratory?â€

â€œTo close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five,â€
replied the valet.

â€œWhat then?â€

â€œAh, my dear count,â€ said Albert.

â€œNo, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you
have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting
Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.â€

â€œThen to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.â€

â€œYou hearâ€”Major Bartolomeo Cavalcantiâ€”a man who ranks amongst the most
ancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth
canto of _The Inferno_, you remember it, do you not? Then there is his
son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount,
bearing the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into
the Parisian world, aided by his fatherâ€™s millions. The major will
bring his son with him this evening, the _contino_, as we say in Italy;
he confides him to my care. If he proves himself worthy of it, I will
do what I can to advance his interests. You will assist me in the work,
will you not?â€

â€œMost undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
then?â€

â€œBy no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
agreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of
very ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence,
Bologna and Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his
arrival in Paris. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort
of claim on one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention
which you once paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a
passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the
man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your
journey. This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of
Paris, which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire,
when he was on his way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he
will confide his son to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I
shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then
I shall have done my part.â€

â€œCertainly; I see you are a model Mentor,â€ said Albert â€œGood-bye, we
shall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.â€

â€œHave you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?â€

â€œI believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says you
were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy;
I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains.â€

â€œHis opinion of me is altered for the better, then?â€

â€œNo, he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible
and mysterious of beings.â€

â€œHe is a charming young man,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œand I felt a lively
interest in him the very first evening of my introduction, when I met
him in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a portion
of mine. He is, I think, the son of General dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œHe is.â€

â€œThe same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?â€

â€œBy the Bonapartists.â€

â€œYes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial
engagement contemplated for him?â€

â€œYes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.â€

â€œIndeed?â€

30115m



â€œAnd you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,â€ said Albert,
laughing.

â€œYou smile.â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhy do you do so?â€

â€œI smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination
for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my
own. But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they
do of us; it is unpardonable.â€

Albert rose.

â€œAre you going?â€

â€œReally, that is a good idea!â€”two hours have I been boring you to death
with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if
I am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world.
And your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite
a style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get
such a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see
in a play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit
themselves in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part
with M. Baptistin, give me the refusal of him.â€

â€œBy all means.â€

â€œThat is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,
Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing
to establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her
motherâ€™s side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will
help you in the search.â€

â€œAh, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, really, nothing is certain in this world.â€

â€œOh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a
hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain
a bachelor, even were it only for ten years.â€

â€œNothing is impossible,â€ gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave
of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.
Bertuccio appeared.

â€œMonsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend entertaining company
on Saturday at Auteuil.â€ Bertuccio slightly started. â€œI shall require
your services to see that all be properly arranged. It is a beautiful
house, or at all events may be made so.â€

â€œThere must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your
excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.â€

â€œLet them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of
the sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave that
exactly as it is.â€ Bertuccio bowed. â€œYou will not touch the garden
either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should
prefer that being altered beyond all recognition.â€

â€œI will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your
excellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellencyâ€™s
commands concerning the dinner.â€

â€œReally, my dear M. Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œsince you have been in
Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your
element; you no longer seem to understand me.â€

â€œBut surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you
are expecting to receive?â€

â€œI do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do
so. â€˜Lucullus dines with Lucullus,â€™ that is quite sufficient.â€

Bertuccio bowed, and left the room.



 Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti

Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to
Morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo
as a pretext for declining Albertâ€™s invitation. Seven oâ€™clock had just
struck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given
him, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the
door, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately
hurried away, as if ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about
fifty-two years of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts,
ornamented with black frogs, which have so long maintained their
popularity all over Europe. He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots
tolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and a little too
thick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape
those usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with
white, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will,
might have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble one. Such was
the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate, and
demanded if it was not at No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es that
the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and who, being answered by the porter
in the affirmative, entered, closed the gate after him, and began to
ascend the steps.

The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray
moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had
received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
awaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was
ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to
meet him with a smiling air.

â€œAh, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I was expecting you.â€

â€œIndeed,â€ said the Italian, â€œwas your excellency then aware of my
visit?â€

â€œYes; I had been told that I should see you today at seven oâ€™clock.â€

â€œThen you have received full information concerning my arrival?â€

â€œOf course.â€

â€œAh, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have
been forgotten.â€

30119m



â€œWhat precaution?â€

â€œThat of informing you beforehand of my coming.â€

â€œOh, no, it has not.â€

â€œBut you are sure you are not mistaken.â€

â€œVery sure.â€

â€œIt really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oâ€™clock this
evening?â€

â€œI will prove it to you beyond a doubt.â€

â€œOh, no, never mind that,â€ said the Italian; â€œit is not worth the
trouble.â€

â€œYes, yes,â€ said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.
â€œLet me see,â€ said the count; â€œare you not the Marquis Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti?â€

â€œBartolomeo Cavalcanti,â€ joyfully replied the Italian; â€œyes, I am
really he.â€

â€œEx-major in the Austrian service?â€

â€œWas I a major?â€ timidly asked the old soldier.

â€œYes,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œyou were a major; that is the title the
French give to the post which you filled in Italy.â€

â€œVery good,â€ said the major, â€œI do not demand more, you understandâ€”â€”â€

â€œYour visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?â€ said
Monte Cristo.

â€œNo, certainly not.â€

â€œYou were sent by some other person?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBy the excellent AbbÃ© Busoni?â€

â€œExactly so,â€ said the delighted major.

â€œAnd you have a letter?â€

â€œYes, there it is.â€

â€œGive it to me, then.â€ And Monte Cristo took the letter, which he
opened and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring
eyes, and then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost
immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room.

â€œYes, yes, I see. â€˜Major Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of Lucca, a
descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence,â€™â€ continued Monte Cristo,
reading aloud, â€œâ€˜possessing an income of half a million.â€™â€

Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed.

â€œHalf a million,â€ said he, â€œmagnificent!â€

â€œHalf a million, is it?â€ said the major.

â€œYes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbÃ© knows correctly
the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.â€

â€œBe it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea
that it was so much.â€

â€œBecause you are robbed by your steward. You must make some reformation
in that quarter.â€

â€œYou have opened my eyes,â€ said the Italian gravely; â€œI will show the
gentlemen the door.â€

Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:

â€œâ€˜And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.â€™â€

â€œYes, indeed but one!â€ said the major with a sigh.

â€œâ€˜Which is to recover a lost and adored son.â€™â€

â€œA lost and adored son!â€

â€œâ€˜Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or
by the gypsies.â€™â€

â€œAt the age of five years!â€ said the major with a deep sigh, and
raising his eye to heaven.

â€œUnhappy father,â€ said Monte Cristo. The count continued:

â€œâ€˜I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance that you
have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for
fifteen years.â€™â€

The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of
anxiety.

â€œI have the power of so doing,â€ said Monte Cristo. The major recovered
his self-possession.

â€œSo, then,â€ said he, â€œthe letter was true to the end?â€

â€œDid you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?â€

â€œNo, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,
as does the AbbÃ© Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a
joke; but your excellency has not read all.â€

â€œAh, true,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œthere is a postscript.â€

â€œYes, yes,â€ repeated the major, â€œyesâ€”thereâ€”isâ€”aâ€”postscript.â€

â€œâ€˜In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his
banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
you still owe me.â€™â€

The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with
great anxiety.

â€œVery good,â€ said the count.

â€œHe said â€˜very good,â€™â€ muttered the major, â€œthenâ€”sirâ€”â€”â€ replied he.

â€œThen what?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œThen the postscriptâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell; what of the postscript?â€

â€œThen the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the
letter?â€

â€œCertainly; the AbbÃ© Busoni and myself have a small account open
between us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I
am still owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference.
You attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear
Monsieur Cavalcanti?â€

â€œI must explain to you,â€ said the major, â€œthat, fully confiding in the
signature of the AbbÃ© Busoni, I had not provided myself with any other
funds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should have found
myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.â€

â€œIs it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed
anywhere?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œWhy, really I know no one,â€ said the major.

â€œBut then you yourself are known to others?â€

â€œYes, I am known, so thatâ€”â€”â€

â€œProceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.â€

â€œSo that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?â€

â€œCertainly, at your first request.â€ The majorâ€™s eyes dilated with
pleasing astonishment. â€œBut sit down,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œreally I do
not know what I have been thinking ofâ€”I have positively kept you
standing for the last quarter of an hour.â€

â€œDonâ€™t mention it.â€ The major drew an armchair towards him, and
proceeded to seat himself.

â€œNow,â€ said the count, â€œwhat will you takeâ€”a glass of sherry, port, or
Alicante?â€

â€œAlicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.â€

â€œI have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it, will
you not?â€

â€œYes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.â€

Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.

â€œWell?â€ said he in a low voice.

â€œThe young man is here,â€ said the valet de chambre in the same tone.

â€œInto what room did you take him?â€

â€œInto the blue drawing-room, according to your excellencyâ€™s orders.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.â€

Baptistin left the room.

â€œReally,â€ said the major, â€œI am quite ashamed of the trouble I am
giving you.â€

â€œPray donâ€™t mention such a thing,â€ said the count. Baptistin re-entered
with glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled one glass, but in
the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. The
bottle was covered with spidersâ€™ webs, and all the other signs which
indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a manâ€™s face.
The major made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. The
count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who
began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction,
and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.

30123m



â€œSo, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in
great esteemâ€”had all that could render a man happy?â€

â€œAll,â€ said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, â€œpositively
all.â€

â€œAnd yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
happiness?â€

â€œOnly one thing,â€ said the Italian.

â€œAnd that one thing, your lost child.â€

â€œAh,â€ said the major, taking a second biscuit, â€œthat consummation of my
happiness was indeed wanting.â€ The worthy major raised his eyes to
heaven and sighed.

â€œLet me hear, then,â€ said the count, â€œwho this deeply regretted son
was; for I always understood you were a bachelor.â€

â€œThat was the general opinion, sir,â€ said the major, â€œand Iâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the count, â€œand you confirmed the report. A youthful
indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the
world at large?â€

The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm manner, at the
same time casting his eyes down, either to give himself time to compose
his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the while giving an
under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose lips still
announced the same polite curiosity.

â€œYes,â€ said the major, â€œI did wish this fault to be hidden from every
eye.â€

â€œNot on your own account, surely,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œfor a man is
above that sort of thing?â€

â€œOh, no, certainly not on my own account,â€ said the major with a smile
and a shake of the head.

â€œBut for the sake of the mother?â€ said the count.

â€œYes, for the motherâ€™s sakeâ€”his poor mother!â€ cried the major, taking a
third biscuit.

â€œTake some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,â€ said the count, pouring out
for him a second glass of Alicante; â€œyour emotion has quite overcome
you.â€

â€œHis poor mother,â€ murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal
gland in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false
tear.

â€œShe belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she
not?â€

â€œShe was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.â€

â€œAnd her name wasâ€”â€”â€

â€œDo you desire to know her nameâ€”â€”?â€

â€œOh,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œit would be quite superfluous for you to tell
me, for I already know it.â€

â€œThe count knows everything,â€ said the Italian, bowing.

â€œOliva Corsinari, was it not?â€

â€œOliva Corsinari!â€

â€œA marchioness?â€

â€œA marchioness!â€

â€œAnd you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
family?â€

â€œYes, that was the way it ended.â€

â€œAnd you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?â€ said Monte
Cristo.

â€œWhat papers?â€

â€œThe certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the
register of your childâ€™s birth.â€

â€œThe register of my childâ€™s birth?â€

â€œThe register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiâ€”of your son; is not his
name Andrea?â€

â€œI believe so,â€ said the major.

â€œWhat? You believe so?â€

â€œI dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a
time.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œyou have all the documents with you?â€

â€œYour excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to
come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.â€

â€œThat is unfortunate,â€ returned Monte Cristo.

â€œWere they, then, so necessary?â€

â€œThey were indispensable.â€

The major passed his hand across his brow. â€œAh, _perbacco_,
indispensable, were they?â€

â€œCertainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to
the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?â€

â€œTrue,â€ said the major, â€œthere might be doubts raised.â€

â€œIn that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.â€

â€œIt would be fatal to his interests.â€

â€œIt might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.â€

â€œ_O peccato!_â€

â€œYou must know that in France they are very particular on these points;
it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, â€˜We
love each other, and want you to marry us.â€™ Marriage is a civil affair
in France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have
papers which undeniably establish your identity.â€

â€œThat is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.â€

â€œFortunately, I have them, though,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œYou?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou have them?â€

â€œI have them.â€

â€œAh, indeed?â€ said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey
frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his
forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000
francsâ€”â€œah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really
is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.â€

â€œI do not at all wonder at itâ€”one cannot think of everything; but,
happily, the AbbÃ© Busoni thought for you.â€

â€œHe is an excellent person.â€

â€œHe is extremely prudent and thoughtful.â€

â€œHe is an admirable man,â€ said the major; â€œand he sent them to you?â€

â€œHere they are.â€

The major clasped his hands in token of admiration.

â€œYou married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del
Monte-Cattini; here is the priestâ€™s certificate.â€

â€œYes indeed, there it is truly,â€ said the Italian, looking on with
astonishment.

â€œAnd here is Andrea Cavalcantiâ€™s baptismal register, given by the curÃ©
of Saravezza.â€

â€œAll quite correct.â€

â€œTake these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give them
to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.â€

â€œI should think so, indeed! If he were to lose themâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell, and if he were to lose them?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œIn that case,â€ replied the major, â€œit would be necessary to write to
the curÃ© for duplicates, and it would be some time before they could be
obtained.â€

â€œIt would be a difficult matter to arrange,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œAlmost an impossibility,â€ replied the major.

â€œI am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.â€

â€œI regard them as invaluable.â€

â€œNow,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œas to the mother of the young manâ€”â€”â€

â€œAs to the mother of the young manâ€”â€”â€ repeated the Italian, with
anxiety.

â€œAs regards the Marchesa Corsinariâ€”â€”â€

â€œReally,â€ said the major, â€œdifficulties seem to thicken upon us; will
she be wanted in any way?â€

â€œNo, sir,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbesides, has she notâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ said the major, â€œshe hasâ€”â€”â€

30127m



â€œPaid the last debt of nature?â€

â€œAlas, yes,â€ returned the Italian.

â€œI knew that,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œshe has been dead these ten years.â€

â€œAnd I am still mourning her loss,â€ exclaimed the major, drawing from
his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the
left and then the right eye.

â€œWhat would you have?â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œwe are all mortal. Now, you
understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to
tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for
fifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are not at all
in vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed. You sent
him for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you
wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is the
reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived
since the death of your wife. That will be sufficient.â€

â€œYou think so?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œVery well, then.â€

â€œIf they should hear of the separationâ€”â€”â€

â€œAh, yes; what could I say?â€

â€œThat an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your familyâ€”â€”â€

â€œBy the Corsinari?â€

â€œPrecisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might
become extinct.â€

â€œThat is reasonable, since he is an only son.â€

â€œWell, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
remembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I
was preparing a surprise for you?â€

â€œAn agreeable one?â€ asked the Italian.

â€œAh, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
heart.â€

â€œHum!â€ said the major.

â€œSomeone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was
here.â€

â€œThat who was here?â€

â€œYour childâ€”your sonâ€”your Andrea!â€

â€œI did guess it,â€ replied the major with the greatest possible
coolness. â€œThen he is here?â€

â€œHe is,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œwhen the valet de chambre came in just
now, he told me of his arrival.â€

â€œAh, very well, very well,â€ said the major, clutching the buttons of
his coat at each exclamation.

â€œMy dear sir,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œI understand your emotion; you must
have time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare
the young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is
not less impatient for it than yourself.â€

â€œI should quite imagine that to be the case,â€ said Cavalcanti.

â€œWell, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.â€

â€œYou will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to
present him to me yourself?â€

â€œNo; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview
will be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of
nature should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by
this door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexionâ€”a little too
fair, perhapsâ€”pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for
yourself.â€

â€œBy the way,â€ said the major, â€œyou know I have only the 2,000 francs
which the AbbÃ© Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling
expenses, andâ€”â€”â€

â€œAnd you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.
Well, here are 8,000 francs on account.â€

The majorâ€™s eyes sparkled brilliantly.

â€œIt is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œDoes your excellency wish for a receipt?â€ said the major, at the same
time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.

â€œFor what?â€ said the count.

â€œI thought you might want it to show the AbbÃ© Busoni.â€

â€œWell, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a
receipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I
think, quite unnecessary.â€

â€œYes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.â€

â€œOne word more,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œSay on.â€

â€œYou will permit me to make one remark?â€

â€œCertainly; pray do so.â€

â€œThen I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.â€

â€œIndeed,â€ said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete
satisfaction.

â€œYes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant
in itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.â€

â€œThatâ€™s unfortunate.â€

â€œOh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can
easily resume it when you leave Paris.â€

â€œBut what shall I wear?â€

â€œWhat you find in your trunks.â€

â€œIn my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.â€

â€œI dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring
oneâ€™s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to
march with as little baggage as possible.â€

â€œThat is just the caseâ€”precisely so.â€

â€œBut you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your
luggage on before you. It has arrived at the HÃ´tel des Princes, Rue de
Richelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.â€

â€œThen, in these trunksâ€”â€”â€

â€œI presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all
you are likely to need,â€”your plain clothes and your uniform. On grand
occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do not
forget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet always
wear them, for all that.â€

â€œVery well, very well,â€ said the major, who was in ecstasy at the
attention paid him by the count.

â€œNow,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œthat you have fortified yourself against all
painful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M. Cavalcanti, to meet
your lost Andrea.â€

Saying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared behind the tapestry,
leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful
reception which he had received at the hands of the count.



 Chapter 56. Andrea Cavalcanti

The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin
had designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of
graceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab
about half an hour previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty
in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for
admittance. He was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red
beard, black eyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so
particularly described to him. When the count entered the room the
young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the
gold-headed cane which he held in his hand. On perceiving the count he
rose quickly.

â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?â€ said he.

â€œYes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea
Cavalcanti?â€

â€œCount Andrea Cavalcanti,â€ repeated the young man, accompanying his
words with a bow.

â€œYou are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are you
not?â€ said the count.

â€œI did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so
strange.â€

â€œThe letter signed â€˜Sinbad the Sailor,â€™ is it not?â€

â€œExactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception
of the one celebrated in the _Thousand and One Nights_â€”â€”â€

â€œWell, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is
a very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name
is Lord Wilmore.â€

â€œAh, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,â€ said
Andrea. â€œHe is, then, the same Englishman whom I metâ€”atâ€”ahâ€”yes, indeed.
Well, monsieur, I am at your service.â€

â€œIf what you say be true,â€ replied the count, smiling, â€œperhaps you
will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your
family?â€

â€œCertainly, I will do so,â€ said the young man, with a quickness which
gave proof of his ready invention. â€œI am (as you have said) the Count
Andrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of
the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at
Florence. Our family, although still rich (for my fatherâ€™s income
amounts to half a million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I
myself was, at the age of five years, taken away by the treachery of my
tutor, so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my
existence. Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my
own master, I have been constantly seeking him, but all in vain. At
length I received this letter from your friend, which states that my
father is in Paris, and authorizes me to address myself to you for
information respecting him.â€

â€œReally, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,â€ said
Monte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; â€œand
you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend
Sinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.â€

The count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not
once lost sight of the expression of the young manâ€™s countenance; he
had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice;
but at these words, so natural in themselves, â€œYour father is indeed
here, and is seeking you,â€ young Andrea started, and exclaimed, â€œMy
father? Is my father here?â€

â€œMost undoubtedly,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œyour father, Major
Bartolomeo Cavalcanti.â€ The expression of terror which, for the moment,
had overspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared.

â€œAh, yes, that is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And
you really mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?â€

â€œYes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the
quick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might
furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he
one day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now
offered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be
found, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of
ransom. Your father did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent
to the frontier of Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were
in the south of France, I think?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, â€œI was in the south of
France.â€

â€œA carriage was to await you at Nice?â€

â€œPrecisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to
Turin, from Turin to ChambÃ©ry, from ChambÃ©ry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and
from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.â€

30133m



â€œIndeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road, for
it is exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we
have been able to trace your journey to this place.â€

â€œBut,â€ said Andrea, â€œif my father had met me, I doubt if he would have
recognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me.â€

â€œOh, the voice of nature,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œTrue,â€ interrupted the young man, â€œI had not looked upon it in that
light.â€

â€œNow,â€ replied Monte Cristo â€œthere is only one source of uneasiness
left in your fatherâ€™s mind, which is thisâ€”he is anxious to know how you
have been employed during your long absence from him, how you have been
treated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves
towards you with all the deference due to your rank. Finally, he is
anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad
moral influence to which you have been exposed, and which is infinitely
more to be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to discover
if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been
weakened by want of culture; and, in short, whether you consider
yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high
position to which your rank entitles you.â€

â€œSir!â€ exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, â€œI hope no false
reportâ€”â€”â€

â€œAs for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the
philanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but
do not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have been
interesting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the
position which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until
he found him. He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is
here now; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave
me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite
aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as
rich as a gold mine, consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities
without any fear of their ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to
his instructions. Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I
am about to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your
patron. I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to
youâ€”misfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree
diminish my regard for youâ€”I would wish to know if they have not, in
some measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in
which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous
figure?â€

â€œSir,â€ returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, â€œmake your
mind easy on this score. Those who took me from my father, and who
always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original
proprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make
the most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in
possession of all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to
increase the value, if possible. I have, therefore, received a very
good education, and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as
the slaves were treated in Asia Minor, whose masters made them
grammarians, doctors, and philosophers, in order that they might fetch
a higher price in the Roman market.â€

Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had not
expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti.

â€œBesides,â€ continued the young man, â€œif there did appear some defect in
education, or offence against the established forms of etiquette, I
suppose it would be excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which
accompanied my birth, and followed me through my youth.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, â€œyou will do as you
please, count, for you are the master of your own actions, and are the
person most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I would not
divulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a romance,
and the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely
mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they
be gilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I wished
to represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited your
touching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed
unlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found, but
you would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a
mushroom in the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is
not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the
subject of unpleasant remark.â€

â€œI agree with you, monsieur,â€ said the young man, turning pale, and, in
spite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his
companion, â€œsuch consequences would be extremely unpleasant.â€

â€œNevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil,â€ said Monte Cristo,
â€œfor by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another. You
must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man
of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must
form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice
which may attach to the obscurity of your former life.â€

Andrea visibly changed countenance.

â€œI would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser,â€ said Monte
Cristo, â€œdid I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a
sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in
departing from this rule, I should (as the actors say) be playing a
part quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run the risk of being
hissed, which would be an act of folly.â€

â€œHowever, your excellency,â€ said Andrea, â€œin consideration of Lord
Wilmore, by whom I was recommended to youâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes, certainly,â€ interrupted Monte Cristo; â€œbut Lord Wilmore did not
omit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was
rather a stormy one. Ah,â€ said the count, watching Andreaâ€™s
countenance, â€œI do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely
to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca. You
shall soon see him. He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and
he is disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has
been for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be
pardoned. We are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In
short, you will find your father a very presentable person, I assure
you.â€

â€œAh, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were
separated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides,
you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all
defects.â€

â€œHe is a millionaireâ€”his income is 500,000 francs.â€

â€œThen,â€ said the young man, with anxiety, â€œI shall be sure to be placed
in an agreeable position.â€

â€œOne of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an
income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in
Paris.â€

â€œThen in that case I shall always choose to remain there.â€

â€œYou cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; â€˜man proposes, and God
disposes.â€™â€ Andrea sighed.

â€œBut,â€ said he, â€œso long as I do remain in Paris, and nothing forces me
to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum
you just now mentioned to me?â€

â€œYou may.â€

â€œShall I receive it from my father?â€ asked Andrea, with some
uneasiness.

â€œYes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord Wilmore
will be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your
father, opened an account of 5,000 francs a month at M. Danglarsâ€™,
which is one of the safest banks in Paris.â€

â€œAnd does my father mean to remain long in Paris?â€ asked Andrea.

â€œOnly a few days,â€ replied Monte Cristo. â€œHis service does not allow
him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together.â€

â€œAh, my dear father!â€ exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea
of his speedy departure.

â€œTherefore,â€ said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his
meaningâ€”â€œtherefore I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure
of your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father?â€

â€œI hope you do not doubt it.â€

30137m



â€œGo, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find
your father awaiting you.â€

Andrea made a low bow to the count, and entered the adjoining room.
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared, and then touched a spring
in a panel made to look like a picture, which, in sliding partly from
the frame, discovered to view a small opening, so cleverly contrived
that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied
by Cavalcanti and Andrea. The young man closed the door behind him, and
advanced towards the major, who had risen when he heard steps
approaching him.

â€œAh, my dear father!â€ said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the
count might hear him in the next room, â€œis it really you?â€

â€œHow do you do, my dear son?â€ said the major gravely.

â€œAfter so many years of painful separation,â€ said Andrea, in the same
tone of voice, and glancing towards the door, â€œwhat a happiness it is
to meet again!â€

â€œIndeed it is, after so long a separation.â€

â€œWill you not embrace me, sir?â€ said Andrea.

30139m



â€œIf you wish it, my son,â€ said the major; and the two men embraced each
other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each
rested his head on the otherâ€™s shoulder.

â€œThen we are once more reunited?â€ said Andrea.

â€œOnce more,â€ replied the major.

â€œNever more to be separated?â€

â€œWhy, as to thatâ€”I think, my dear son, you must be by this time so
accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country.â€

â€œThe fact is,â€ said the young man, â€œthat I should be exceedingly
grieved to leave it.â€

â€œAs for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca;
therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can.â€

â€œBut before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me in
possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my
descent.â€

â€œCertainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much
trouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,
and if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few
remaining years of my life.â€

â€œWhere are these papers, then?â€

â€œHere they are.â€

Andrea seized the certificate of his fatherâ€™s marriage and his own
baptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness
which might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a
facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and
with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the
contents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression
of pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a
most peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan:

â€œThen there is no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to
the galleys?â€

The major drew himself up to his full height.

â€œWhy?â€”what do you mean by that question?â€

â€œI mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with
impunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a
piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to
Toulon for five years, for change of air.â€

â€œWill you be good enough to explain your meaning?â€ said the major,
endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest
majesty.

â€œMy dear M. Cavalcanti,â€ said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a
confidential manner, â€œhow much are you paid for being my father?â€

The major was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a low voice:

â€œNonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me
50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand
that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.â€

The major looked anxiously around him.

â€œMake yourself easy, we are quite alone,â€ said Andrea; â€œbesides, we are
conversing in Italian.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ replied the major, â€œthey paid me 50,000 francs down.â€

â€œMonsieur Cavalcanti,â€ said Andrea, â€œdo you believe in fairy tales?â€

â€œI used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have
faith in them.â€

â€œYou have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some
proofs of their truth?â€ The major drew from his pocket a handful of
gold.

â€œMost palpable proofs,â€ said he, â€œas you may perceive.â€

â€œYou think, then, that I may rely on the countâ€™s promises?â€

â€œCertainly I do.â€

â€œYou are sure he will keep his word with me?â€

â€œTo the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to
play our respective parts. I, as a tender fatherâ€”â€”â€

â€œAnd I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from
you.â€

â€œWhom do you mean by they?â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the
letter; you received one, did you not?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œFrom whom?â€

â€œFrom a certain AbbÃ© Busoni.â€

â€œHave you any knowledge of him?â€

â€œNo, I have never seen him.â€

â€œWhat did he say in the letter?â€

â€œYou will promise not to betray me?â€

â€œRest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.â€

â€œThen read for yourself;â€ and the major gave a letter into the young
manâ€™s hand. Andrea read in a low voice:

â€œâ€˜You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to
become rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris,
and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, No.
30, the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken
from you at five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In
order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this
letter, you will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in
Florence, at Signor Gozziâ€™s; also a letter of introduction to the Count
of Monte Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember
to go to the count on the 26th May at seven oâ€™clock in the evening.


â€œ(Signed) â€˜AbbÃ© Busoni.â€™â€


â€œIt is the same.â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ said the major.

â€œI was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same
effect.â€

â€œYou?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œFrom the AbbÃ© Busoni?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œFrom whom, then?â€

â€œFrom an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad
the Sailor.â€

â€œAnd of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the AbbÃ© Busoni?â€

â€œYou are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.â€

â€œYou have seen him, then?â€

â€œYes, once.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œAh, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you
as wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.â€

â€œAnd what did the letter contain?â€

â€œRead it.â€

â€œâ€˜You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy. Do you
wish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?â€™â€


â€œ_Parbleu!_â€ said the young man; â€œwas it possible there could be two
answers to such a question?â€

â€œâ€˜Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de
GÃªnes, as you enter Nice; pass through Turin, ChambÃ©ry, and
Pont-de-Beauvoisin. Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des
Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, on the 26th of May, at seven oâ€™clock in the evening,
and demand of him your father. You are the son of the Marchese
Cavalcanti and the Marchesa Oliva Corsinari. The marquis will give you
some papers which will certify this fact, and authorize you to appear
under that name in the Parisian world. As to your rank, an annual
income of 50,000 livres will enable you to support it admirably. I
enclose a draft for 5,000 livres, payable on M. Ferrea, banker at Nice,
and also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, whom I
have directed to supply all your wants.


â€œâ€˜Sinbad the Sailor.â€™â€


â€œHumph,â€ said the major; â€œvery good. You have seen the count, you say?â€

â€œI have only just left him.â€

â€œAnd has he conformed to all that the letter specified?â€

â€œHe has.â€

â€œDo you understand it?â€

â€œNot in the least.â€

â€œThere is a dupe somewhere.â€

â€œAt all events, it is neither you nor I.â€

â€œCertainly not.â€

â€œWell, thenâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhy, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?â€

â€œNo; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and
consent to be blindfolded.â€

â€œAh, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to
admiration.â€

â€œI never once doubted your doing so.â€ Monte Cristo chose this moment
for re-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his
footsteps, the two men threw themselves in each otherâ€™s arms, and while
they were in the midst of this embrace, the count entered.

â€œWell, marquis,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œyou appear to be in no way
disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you.â€

â€œAh, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight.â€

â€œAnd what are your feelings?â€ said Monte Cristo, turning to the young
man.

â€œAs for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.â€

â€œHappy father, happy son!â€ said the count.

â€œThere is only one thing which grieves me,â€ observed the major, â€œand
that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.â€

â€œAh, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have
had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends.â€

â€œI am at your service, sir,â€ replied the major.

â€œNow, sir,â€ said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, â€œmake your
confession.â€

â€œTo whom?â€

â€œTell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_ monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.â€

â€œDo you hear what he says, major?â€

â€œCertainly I do.â€

â€œBut do you understand?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œYour son says he requires money.â€

â€œWell, what would you have me do?â€ said the major.

â€œYou should furnish him with some of course,â€ replied Monte Cristo.

â€œI?â€

â€œYes, you,â€ said the count, at the same time advancing towards Andrea,
and slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young manâ€™s hand.

â€œWhat is this?â€

â€œIt is from your father.â€

â€œFrom my father?â€

â€œYes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well, then,
he deputes me to give you this.â€

â€œAm I to consider this as part of my income on account?â€

â€œNo, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris.â€

â€œAh, how good my dear father is!â€

â€œSilence,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œhe does not wish you to know that it
comes from him.â€

â€œI fully appreciate his delicacy,â€ said Andrea, cramming the notes
hastily into his pocket.

â€œAnd now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œAnd when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your
excellency?â€ asked Cavalcanti.

â€œAh,â€ said Andrea, â€œwhen may we hope for that pleasure?â€

â€œOn Saturday, if you willâ€”Yes.â€”Let me seeâ€”Saturdayâ€”I am to dine at my
country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.
Several persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your
banker. I will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should
know you, as he is to pay your money.â€

â€œFull dress?â€ said the major, half aloud.

â€œOh, yes, certainly,â€ said the count; â€œuniform, cross, knee-breeches.â€

â€œAnd how shall I be dressed?â€ demanded Andrea.

30145m



â€œOh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white
waistcoat, either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin
or VÃ©ronique for your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do
not know their address. The less pretension there is in your attire,
the better will be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to
buy any horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go
to Baptiste for it.â€

â€œAt what hour shall we come?â€ asked the young man.

â€œAbout half-past six.â€

â€œWe will be with you at that time,â€ said the major. The two Cavalcanti
bowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to the
window, and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm.

â€œThere go two miscreants;â€ said he, â€œit is a pity they are not really
related!â€ Then, after an instant of gloomy reflection, â€œCome, I will go
to see the Morrels,â€ said he; â€œI think that disgust is even more
sickening than hatred.â€

30147m




 Chapter 57. In the Lucern Patch

Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure
surrounding M. de Villefortâ€™s house, and, behind the gate, half
screened from view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides
spread their luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our
acquaintance. This time Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was
intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting
with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk.

At length, the long-desired sound was heard, and instead of one figure,
as he had expected, he perceived that two were approaching him. The
delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and EugÃ©nie,
which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was
expected. That she might not appear to fail in her promise to
Maximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take
a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay, which was
doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by any neglect
on her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover,
quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily
placed, and he was comforted. Besides, although she avoided coming
within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could
see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she managed,
unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at the young
man, which seemed to say, â€œHave patience! You see it is not my fault.â€

And Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally
contrasting the two girls,â€”one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a
figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette,
with a fierce and haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It
is unnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine
did not suffer by the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went
away, and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglarsâ€™ visit had
at last come to an end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the
garden alone. For fear that anyone should be observing her return, she
walked slowly; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards
the gate, she seated herself on a bench, and, carefully casting her
eyes around, to convince herself that she was not watched, she
presently arose, and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian.

â€œGood-evening, Valentine,â€ said a well-known voice.

â€œGood-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw
the cause of my delay.â€

â€œYes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you were
so intimate with her.â€

â€œWho told you we were intimate, Maximilian?â€

â€œNo one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you walked
and talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls
telling your secrets to each other.â€

â€œWe were having a confidential conversation,â€ returned Valentine; â€œshe
was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and
I, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to
think of marrying M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

â€œDear Valentine!â€

â€œThat will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed
between me and EugÃ©nie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not
love, my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections
were fixed.â€

â€œAh, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality which
can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable charm
which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the
fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.â€

â€œIt is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.â€

â€œNo, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing you
both when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at
all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot
understand how any man can really love her.â€

â€œThe fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the
effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison.â€

â€œNo; but tell meâ€”it is a question of simple curiosity, and which was
suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle
Danglarsâ€”â€”â€

â€œI dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say. It
only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,â€
interrupted Valentine.

â€œYou cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each
other.â€

â€œIf we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence of
excitement. But return to your question.â€

30151m



â€œDoes Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf
on account of loving another?â€

â€œI told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with EugÃ©nie.â€

â€œYes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly
intimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see
you are smiling.â€

â€œIf you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the wooden
partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight
security.â€

â€œCome, what did she say?â€

â€œShe told me that she loved no one,â€ said Valentine; â€œthat she disliked
the idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an
independent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father
might lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her
friend, Mademoiselle Louise dâ€™Armilly.â€

â€œAh, you seeâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell, what does that prove?â€ asked Valentine.

â€œNothing,â€ replied Maximilian.

â€œThen why did you smile?â€

â€œWhy, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,
Valentine.â€

â€œDo you want me to go away?â€

â€œAh, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which
I wish to speak.â€

â€œTrue, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass
together.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_â€ said Maximilian, in consternation.

â€œYes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I cause
you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I
bitterly reproach myself, I assure you.â€

â€œWell, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and
feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five
minutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also a
deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts,
harmonizing as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to
separate us at last.â€

â€œThose are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,
Maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.â€

â€œBut why must you leave me so soon?â€

â€œI do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de
Villefort sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to
make on which a part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune,
I am already too rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will
leave me in peace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were
poor, would you not, Maximilian?â€

â€œOh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches or
poverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one
could deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication
may relate to your marriage?â€

â€œI do not think that is the case.â€

â€œHowever it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you
that, as long as I live, I shall never love anyone else!â€

â€œDo you think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian?â€

â€œPardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you
that I met M. de Morcerf the other day.â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œMonsieur Franz is his friend, you know.â€

â€œWhat then?â€

â€œMonsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his
immediate return.â€ Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against
the gate.

â€œAh heavens, if it were that! But no, the communication would not come
through Madame de Villefort.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œBecauseâ€”I scarcely know whyâ€”but it has appeared as if Madame de
Villefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not
choose openly to oppose it.â€

â€œIs it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort.â€

â€œDo not be in such a hurry to do that,â€ said Valentine, with a sad
smile.

â€œIf she objects to your marrying M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, she would be all the more
likely to listen to any other proposition.â€

â€œNo, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort
objects, it is marriage itself.â€

â€œMarriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry
herself?â€

â€œYou do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of
retiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks
which she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the
proposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was
only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the
project. You can form no idea of the expression of that old manâ€™s eye
when he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and, I
had almost said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my
resolution, I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on
me, and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his
lifeless cheeks. Ah, Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment, such
remorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, I
exclaimed,â€”â€˜Forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may
do what they will with me, I will never leave you.â€™ When I had ceased
speaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering
a word. Ah, Maximilian, I may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my
grandfatherâ€™s look at that moment would more than compensate for all.â€

â€œDear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not know
what Iâ€”sabring right and left among the Bedouinsâ€”can have done to merit
your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, Heaven took into
consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But
tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining
unmarried?â€

â€œDid I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilianâ€”too rich? I
possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and
my grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-MÃ©ran, will leave me
as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My
brother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore,
be poor in comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this
fortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his
son.â€

â€œAh, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should
be so avaricious.â€

â€œIt is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you
regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of
maternal love.â€

â€œBut could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your
fortune to her son?â€

â€œHow could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always
professes to be so entirely disinterested?â€

â€œValentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of something
sacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of respect, and
hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being, not even
my sister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit me to
make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?â€

Valentine started. â€œA friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I
tremble to give my permission.â€

â€œListen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden
and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it
had been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the
first time you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to
recall the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse,
and failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits
must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior
to the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of
the past?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first
saw that extraordinary man.â€

â€œExtraordinary, did you say?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou have known him for some time, then?â€

â€œScarcely longer than eight or ten days.â€

â€œAnd do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight
or ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the
title of friend.â€

â€œYour logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can
never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession
of my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be
associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,
and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to
come, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according
to his own will.â€

â€œHe must be a prophet, then,â€ said Valentine, smiling.

â€œIndeed,â€ said Maximilian, â€œI have often been almost tempted to
attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a
wonderful power of foretelling any future good.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Valentine in a mournful tone, â€œdo let me see this man,
Maximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently
to make amends for all I have suffered.â€

â€œMy poor girl, you know him already.â€

â€œI know him?â€

â€œYes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.â€

â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo?â€

â€œThe same.â€

â€œAh,â€ cried Valentine, â€œhe is too much the friend of Madame de
Villefort ever to be mine.â€

â€œThe friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine,
you are mistaken?â€

â€œNo, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household
is almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the
epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never
before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by
Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the countâ€™s large black eyes,
runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he
is sure to find some delightful present,â€”M. de Monte Cristo appears to
exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the
members of our family.â€

â€œIf such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt,
or at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He meets
Albert de Morcerf in Italyâ€”it is to rescue him from the hands of the
banditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglarsâ€”it is that he may
give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his
doorâ€”it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This man
evidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards
men and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater
magnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget
it ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever
looked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you
will be happy.â€

â€œMe?â€ said the young girl, â€œhe never even glances at me; on the
contrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid
me. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural
penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have
perceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me
sad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and
since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart
with one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; how
do you know that he does? All would pay deference to an officer like
you, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think they may
crush a poor weeping girl with impunity.â€

â€œAh, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.â€

â€œIf it were otherwiseâ€”if he treated me diplomaticallyâ€”that is to say,
like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in
the house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its
occupantsâ€”he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the
smile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy, he
understood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no
attention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please Madame
de Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in
his power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any
reason. Ah, forgive me,â€ said Valentine, perceiving the effect which
her words were producing on Maximilian: â€œI have done wrong, for I have
given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even
know existed in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you
speak, or that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has
been productive of evil rather than good.â€

â€œWell, Valentine,â€ said Morrel with a sigh, â€œwe will not discuss the
matter further. I will not make a confidant of him.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said Valentine, â€œI see that I have given you pain. I can only
say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you. But, indeed, I
am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me what this
Count of Monte Cristo has done for you.â€

30157m



â€œI own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say
that the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I have
already told you, I have an instinctive affection for him, the source
of which I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No;
he warms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see
youâ€”nothing more. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No;
its odor charms one of my sensesâ€”that is all I can say when I am asked
why I praise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable
as his for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be
something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of
friendship. In his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret
thoughts, I find a relation to my own. You will perhaps smile at me
when I tell you that, ever since I have known this man, I have
involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has
befallen me originated from him. However, I have managed to live thirty
years without this protection, you will say; but I will endeavor a
little to illustrate my meaning. He invited me to dine with him on
Saturday, which was a very natural thing for him to do. Well, what have
I learned since? That your mother and M. de Villefort are both coming
to this dinner. I shall meet them there, and who knows what future
advantages may result from the interview? This may appear to you to be
no unusual combination of circumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some
hidden plot in the arrangementâ€”something, in fact, more than is
apparent on a casual view of the subject. I believe that this singular
man, who appears to fathom the motives of everyone, has purposely
arranged for me to meet M. and Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I
confess, I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he
was in possession of the secret of our love.â€

â€œMy good friend,â€ said Valentine, â€œI should take you for a visionary,
and should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk
in a strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see anything
more than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a little. My
father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point of
refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is
burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own
house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father
to accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,â€”there is no
one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my
grandfather, who is little better than a corpseâ€”no support to cling to
but my mother in heaven!â€

â€œI see that you are right, logically speaking,â€ said Maximilian; â€œbut
the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince
me today.â€

â€œI feel the same as regards yourself.â€ said Valentine; â€œand I own that,
if you have no stronger proof to give meâ€”â€”â€

â€œI have another,â€ replied Maximilian; â€œbut I fear you will deem it even
more absurd than the first.â€

â€œSo much the worse,â€ said Valentine, smiling.

â€œIt is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service
have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for
I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which
directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left, in
order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side,
while it left me unharmed.â€

â€œDear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers
for your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but
for you.â€

30159m



â€œYes, since you have known me,â€ said Morrel, smiling; â€œbut that cannot
apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.â€

â€œYou are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but
let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.â€

â€œWell, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new
horse which I rode here.â€

â€œAh! what a beautiful creature!â€ cried Valentine; â€œwhy did you not
bring him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?â€

â€œHe is, as you see, a very valuable animal,â€ said Maximilian. â€œYou know
that my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man
of moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealerâ€™s, where I saw
this magnificent horse, which I have named MÃ©dÃ©ah. I asked the price;
they told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give it
up, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy
heart, for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his
head against me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most
delightful way imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with
him. The same evening some friends of mine visited me,â€”M. de
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, M. Debray, and five or six other choice spirits, whom
you do not know, even by name. They proposed a game of _bouillotte_. I
never play, for I am not rich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently
poor to desire to gain. But I was at my own house, you understand, so
there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards, which I did.

â€œJust as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived.
He took his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am almost
ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated at
midnight. I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and
drove to the horse dealerâ€™s. Feverish and excited, I rang at the door.
The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed
at once to the stable. MÃ©dÃ©ah was standing at the rack, eating his hay.
I immediately put on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he lent
himself with the best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs
into the hands of the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my
intention of passing the night in riding in the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es. As I
rode by the countâ€™s house I perceived a light in one of the windows,
and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain.
Now, Valentine, I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess
this horse, and that he lost expressly to give me the means of
procuring him.â€

â€œMy dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love
even me long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of
poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common,
every-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do
you hear?â€

â€œAh, Valentine,â€ said Maximilian, â€œgive me but one finger through this
opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I
may have the happiness of kissing it.â€

â€œMaximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two
shadows.â€

â€œAs you will, Valentine.â€

â€œShall you be happy if I do what you wish?â€

â€œOh, yes!â€

Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her
whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of delight,
and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and
imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was
then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying
towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own
sensations.



 Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort

We will now relate what was passing in the house of the kingâ€™s attorney
after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the
time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we
have just detailed.

M. de Villefort entered his fatherâ€™s room, followed by Madame de
Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and
speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years
in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.

M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in
which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way
drawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which
reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,
which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room
and everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although
almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick
and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious
courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official
character.

Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two
solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed
fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of
these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still
occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his
inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller
sees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being
dwells beyond the silence and obscurity.

Noirtierâ€™s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders;
while in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as
it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the
others, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were
formerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of
the arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were
wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded with it; it
was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed. In short, his
whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with
living eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the
expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the
rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the
power of participation. Three persons only could understand this
language of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and
the old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw
his father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he
never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all
the old manâ€™s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by
means of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read
in Noirtierâ€™s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his
mind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she
answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her
countenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained
between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could
scarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a
fund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as
ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying
its impulses.

Valentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his
thoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring
and devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions
of every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,
thinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.

As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for
five-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was
seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt
was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.

Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in
order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was
about to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old manâ€™s
vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only
indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He
therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,
and after having seated himself at his fatherâ€™s right hand, while
Madame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:

â€œI trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come
with us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one
which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.â€

Noirtierâ€™s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,
while, on the contrary, Villefortâ€™s eye was endeavoring to penetrate
into the inmost recesses of the old manâ€™s heart.

â€œThis communication,â€ continued the procureur, in that cold and
decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, â€œwill,
we are sure, meet with your approbation.â€

The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which
prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which
were passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.

â€œSir,â€ resumed Villefort, â€œwe are thinking of marrying Valentine.â€ Had
the old manâ€™s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less
emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. â€œThe marriage
will take place in less than three months,â€ said Villefort.

Noirtierâ€™s eye still retained its inanimate expression.

Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:

â€œWe thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have
always entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only
now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she
is destined. It is one of the most desirable connections which could
possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and
every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely
happy,â€”his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. It is M.
Franz de Quesnel, Baron dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

While his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old
manâ€™s countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of
Franz, the pupil of M. Noirtierâ€™s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids
trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an
individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame
de Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred
which had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder dâ€™Ã‰pinay,
well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had
produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed
the narrative begun by his wife.

â€œSir,â€ said he, â€œyou are aware that Valentine is about to enter her
nineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no
time in forming a suitable alliance. Nevertheless, you have not been
forgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that
Valentineâ€™s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for
that might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should
live with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each
other, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly
the same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead
of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you
two children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.â€

30165m



Noirtierâ€™s look was furious; it was very evident that something
desperate was passing in the old manâ€™s mind, for a cry of anger and
grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,
appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple
with the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, â€œIt is
very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.â€ He then returned to his
place, but did not sit down.

â€œThis marriage,â€ added Madame de Villefort, â€œis quite agreeable to the
wishes of M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay and his family; besides, he had no relations
nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and
his father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he
was but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was
permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom
acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.â€

â€œThat assassination was a mysterious affair,â€ said Villefort, â€œand the
perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has
fallen on the head of more than one person.â€

Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.

â€œNow,â€ continued Villefort, â€œthose to whom the guilt really belongs, by
whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may
probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would
rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a
peace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so
ruthlessly destroyed.â€ Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion
more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and
shattered frame.

â€œYes, I understand,â€ was the reply contained in his look; and this look
expressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound
contempt. Villefort fully understood his fatherâ€™s meaning, and answered
by a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to
take leave.

â€œNow sir,â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œI must bid you farewell. Would
you like me to send Edward to you for a short time?â€

It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by
closing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he
had some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he
wanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the
left. At Madame de Villefortâ€™s proposition he instantly winked his
eyes.

Provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, â€œThen shall I
send Valentine to you?â€ The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby
intimating that such was his wish.

M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that
Valentine should be summoned to her grandfatherâ€™s presence, and feeling
sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the
perturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still
heightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had
quitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather
was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing
to communicate to her.

â€œDear grandpapa,â€ cried she, â€œwhat has happened? They have vexed you,
and you are angry?â€

The paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.

â€œWho has displeased you? Is it my father?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œMadame de Villefort?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œMe?â€ The former sign was repeated.

â€œAre you displeased with me?â€ cried Valentine in astonishment. M.
Noirtier again closed his eyes.

â€œAnd what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with
me?â€ cried Valentine.

There was no answer, and she continued:

â€œI have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against
me?â€

â€œYes,â€ said the old manâ€™s look, with eagerness.

â€œLet me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapaâ€”Ahâ€”M. and Madame de
Villefort have just left this room, have they not?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was
it then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of
making my peace with you?â€

â€œNo, no,â€ said Noirtierâ€™s look.

â€œAh, you frighten me. What can they have said?â€ and she again tried to
think what it could be.

â€œAh, I know,â€ said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old
man. â€œThey have been speaking of my marriage,â€”have they not?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the angry look.

â€œI understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on
the subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping
the matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They
did not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered
them by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear
grandpapa. Pray forgive me.â€

But there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say
was, â€œIt is not only your reserve which afflicts me.â€

â€œWhat is it, then?â€ asked the young girl. â€œPerhaps you think I shall
abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am
married?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œThey told you, then, that M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay consented to our all living
together?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThen why are you still vexed and grieved?â€ The old manâ€™s eyes beamed
with an expression of gentle affection.

â€œYes, I understand,â€ said Valentine; â€œit is because you love me.â€ The
old man assented.

â€œAnd you are afraid I shall be unhappy?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou do not like M. Franz?â€ The eyes repeated several times, â€œNo, no,
no.â€

â€œThen you are vexed with the engagement?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, listen,â€ said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and
putting her arm round her grandfatherâ€™s neck, â€œI am vexed, too, for I
do not love M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

An expression of intense joy illumined the old manâ€™s eyes.

â€œWhen I wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you
were with me?â€ A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid. â€œWell,â€
continued Valentine, â€œthe reason of my proposing it was that I might
escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.â€ Noirtierâ€™s
breathing came thick and short.

â€œThen the idea of this marriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you
could but help meâ€”if we could both together defeat their plan! But you
are unable to oppose them,â€”you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will
is so firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am
myself. Alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me
in the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my
joys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.
However, this is much, and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken
away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.â€

At these words there appeared in Noirtierâ€™s eye an expression of such
deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words
there: â€œYou are mistaken; I can still do much for you.â€

â€œDo you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?â€ said Valentine.

â€œYes.â€ Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him
and Valentine when he wanted anything.

â€œWhat is it you want, dear grandpapa?â€ said Valentine, and she
endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to
need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated
them aloud, then,â€”finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a
constant _â€œNo,â€_â€”she said, â€œCome, since this plan does not answer, I
will have recourse to another.â€

She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When
she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she
had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.

â€œAh,â€ said Valentine, â€œthe thing you desire begins with the letter N;
it is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what can you
want that begins with N? Naâ€”Neâ€”Niâ€”Noâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes, yes, yes,â€ said the old manâ€™s eye.

â€œAh, it is No, then?â€

â€œYes.â€

Valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before
Noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the old manâ€™s eye was
thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down
the columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first
fell into this sad state, Valentineâ€™s powers of invention had been too
often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients
for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so
perfected her in the art that she guessed the old manâ€™s meaning as
quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At
the word _Notary_, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.

30169m



â€œNotary,â€ said she, â€œdo you want a notary, dear grandpapa?â€ The old man
again signified that it was a notary he desired.

â€œYou would wish a notary to be sent for then?â€ said Valentine.

â€œYes.â€

â€œShall my father be informed of your wish?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œDo you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThen they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all you
want?â€

â€œYes.â€ Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell
Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M.
Noirtierâ€™s room.

â€œAre you satisfied now?â€ inquired Valentine.

â€œYes.â€

â€œI am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that.â€ And the
young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de
Villefort entered, followed by Barrois.

â€œWhat do you want me for, sir?â€ demanded he of the paralytic.

â€œSir,â€ said Valentine, â€œmy grandfather wishes for a notary.â€ At this
strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged
looks.

â€œYes,â€ motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to declare
that with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who both knew what
his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the contest.

â€œDo you wish for a notary?â€ asked Villefort.

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhat to do?â€

Noirtier made no answer.

â€œWhat do you want with a notary?â€ again repeated Villefort. The
invalidâ€™s eye remained fixed, by which expression he intended to
intimate that his resolution was unalterable.

â€œIs it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?â€ said
Villefort.

â€œStill,â€ said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,
â€œif M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for a
notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.â€ Barrois
acknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in
any way to be contradicted.

30171m



â€œYes, I do want a notary,â€ motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with
a look of defiance, which seemed to say, â€œand I should like to see the
person who dares to refuse my request.â€

â€œYou shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,â€ said
Villefort; â€œbut I shall explain to him your state of health, and make
excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous
one.â€

â€œNever mind that,â€ said Barrois; â€œI shall go and fetch a notary,
nevertheless.â€ And the old servant departed triumphantly on his
mission.



 Chapter 59. The Will

As soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with
a malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly
understood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became
clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and
quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat
himself with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time
giving a side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she
also was to remain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after,
Barrois returned, bringing the notary with him.

â€œSir,â€ said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, â€œyou were
sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All his limbs have become
completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find
much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.â€

Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so
earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.

â€œSir,â€ said she, â€œI perfectly understand my grandfatherâ€™s meaning at
all times.â€

â€œThat is quite true,â€ said Barrois; â€œand that is what I told the
gentleman as we walked along.â€

â€œPermit me,â€ said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to
Valentineâ€”â€œpermit me to state that the case in question is just one of
those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act
without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first thing
necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be
thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and
wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the
approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me,
on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite
useless, and cannot be legally exercised.â€

The notary then prepared to retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph
was expressed on the lips of the procureur. Noirtier looked at
Valentine with an expression so full of grief, that she arrested the
departure of the notary.

â€œSir,â€ said she, â€œthe language which I speak with my grandfather may be
easily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it
almost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in
order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?â€

â€œIn order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation
or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the
validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.â€

â€œWell, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you
presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather
is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M.
Noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey
his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify â€˜yes,â€™ and to
wink when he means â€˜no.â€™ You now know quite enough to enable you to
converse with M. Noirtier;â€”try.â€

Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it
was comprehended even by the notary himself.

â€œYou have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying,
sir, have you?â€ asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes.

â€œAnd you approve of what she saidâ€”that is to say, you declare that the
signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are
accustomed to convey your thoughts?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œIt was you who sent for me?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œTo make your will?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
intentions?â€ The old man winked violently.

â€œWell, sir,â€ said the young girl, â€œdo you understand now, and is your
conscience perfectly at rest on the subject?â€

But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.

â€œSir,â€ said he, â€œdo you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a
physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment
to his mental faculties?â€

â€œIt is not exactly that, sir,â€ said the notary, â€œwhich makes me uneasy,
but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so
as to be able to get his answers.â€

â€œYou must see that to be an utter impossibility,â€ said Villefort.
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed
his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the
look.

â€œSir,â€ said she, â€œthat need not make you uneasy, however difficult it
may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my
grandfatherâ€™s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and
fears on the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and
let him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a
thought which he was unable to make me understand.â€

â€œNo,â€ signed the old man.

â€œLet us try what we can do, then,â€ said the notary. â€œYou accept this
young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you
wish to be drawn up?â€

Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W. At
this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was
to stop.

â€œIt is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,â€
said the notary.

â€œWait,â€ said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated,
â€œWaâ€”Weâ€”Wiâ€”â€”â€ The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine
then took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned
over the pages.

She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the
word â€œWill,â€ M. Noirtierâ€™s eye bade her stop.

â€œWill,â€ said the notary; â€œit is very evident that M. Noirtier is
desirous of making his will.â€

â€œYes, yes, yes,â€ motioned the invalid.

â€œReally, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,â€ said the
astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.

â€œYes,â€ said the procureur, â€œand I think the will promises to be yet
more extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without
the intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as
too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable
interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.â€

â€œNo, no, no,â€ replied the eye of the paralytic.

â€œWhat?â€ said Villefort, â€œdo you mean to say that Valentine is not
interested in your will?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œSir,â€ said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and
who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this
extraordinary and picturesque scene, â€œwhat appeared so impossible to me
an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be
a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven
witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the
presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very
much more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms
necessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the
details, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in
which we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having
had the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the
subject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be
contested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,
therefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,
will assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?â€
continued the notary, addressing the old man.

30175m



â€œYes,â€ looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready
interpretation of his meaning.

â€œWhat is he going to do?â€ thought Villefort, whose position demanded
much reserve, but who was longing to know what his fatherâ€™s intentions
were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent,
but Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his masterâ€™s
wishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his
wife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had
assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also
arrived.

A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two
officers of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will,
in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are
generally couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator,
the first notary said, turning towards him:

â€œWhen an individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in
prejudice of some person.â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHave you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you
will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own
possessions?â€

â€œYes.â€

There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had the
struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it
was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had
formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a
table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the
testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we
have alluded.

â€œYour fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?â€ asked he. Noirtier
made a sign that it did.

â€œDo you possess 400,000 francs?â€ inquired the notary. Noirtierâ€™s eye
remained immovable.

â€œ500,000?â€ The same expression continued.

â€œ600,000â€”700,000â€”800,000â€”900,000?â€

Noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.

â€œYou are then in possession of 900,000 francs?â€ asked the notary.

â€œYes.â€

â€œIn landed property?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œIn stock?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThe stock is in your own hands?â€

The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was
something wanting which he knew where to find. The old servant left the
room, and presently returned, bringing with him a small casket.

â€œDo you permit us to open this casket?â€ asked the notary. Noirtier gave
his assent.

They opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first
notary handed over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague.

The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated.

â€œIt is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still
retains its full force and vigor.â€ Then, turning towards the paralytic,
he said, â€œYou possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which,
according to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring
in an income of about 40,000 livres?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œTo whom do you desire to leave this fortune?â€

â€œOh!â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œthere is not much doubt on that
subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de
Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and
has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had
almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that
she should reap the fruit of her devotion.â€

The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not
deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villefortâ€™s words and
manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain.

â€œIs it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave
these 900,000 francs?â€ demanded the notary, thinking he had only to
insert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which
it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this
singular scene.

Valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had
stepped back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast
down, and she was crying. The old man looked at her for an instant with
an expression of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the
notary, he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent.

â€œWhat,â€ said the notary, â€œdo you not intend making Mademoiselle
Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œYou are not making any mistake, are you?â€ said the notary; â€œyou really
mean to declare that such is not your intention?â€

â€œNo,â€ repeated Noirtier; â€œNo.â€

Valentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so
much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief,
but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked
her grandfather to such an act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much
affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed:

â€œOh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you
deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.â€

â€œAh, yes, most assuredly,â€ said the eyes of the paralytic, for he
closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.

â€œThank you, thank you,â€ murmured she. The old manâ€™s declaration that
Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the
hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and
said:

â€œThen, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to
your grandson, Edward de Villefort?â€

The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and
terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.

â€œNo?â€ said the notary; â€œthen, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de
Villefort?â€

â€œNo.â€ The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and
inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort
and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.

â€œWhat have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?â€ said Valentine; â€œyou no
longer seem to love any of us?â€

The old manâ€™s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and
rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.

â€œWell,â€ said she; â€œif you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love
to bear upon your actions at this present moment. You know me well
enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune;
besides, they say I am already rich in right of my motherâ€”too rich,
even. Explain yourself, then.â€

Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentineâ€™s hand.

â€œMy hand?â€ said she.

â€œYes.â€

â€œHer hand!â€ exclaimed everyone.

â€œOh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my fatherâ€™s mind is
really impaired,â€ said Villefort.

â€œAh,â€ cried Valentine suddenly, â€œI understand. It is my marriage you
mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?â€

â€œYes, yes, yes,â€ signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of
joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.

30179m



â€œYou are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?â€

â€œYes?â€

â€œReally, this is too absurd,â€ said Villefort.

â€œExcuse me, sir,â€ replied the notary; â€œon the contrary, the meaning of
M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the
train of ideas passing in his mind.â€

â€œYou do not wish me to marry M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€ observed Valentine.

â€œI do not wish it,â€ said the eye of her grandfather.

â€œAnd you disinherit your granddaughter,â€ continued the notary, â€œbecause
she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œSo that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?â€

â€œYes.â€

There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding a
consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense
gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while
Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling
of joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.

â€œBut,â€ said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, â€œI
consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in
question. I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my
daughterâ€™s hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz
dâ€™Ã‰pinayâ€”and she shall marry him.â€

Valentine sank weeping into a chair.

â€œSir,â€ said the notary, â€œhow do you intend disposing of your fortune in
case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?â€
The old man gave no answer.

â€œYou will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œIn favor of some member of your family?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œDo you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?â€ pursued the
notary.

â€œYes.â€

â€œBut,â€ said the notary, â€œyou are aware that the law does not allow a
son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which
the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?â€
Noirtier made no answer.

â€œDo you still wish to dispose of all?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBut they will contest the will after your death?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œMy father knows me,â€ replied Villefort; â€œhe is quite sure that his
wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my
position I cannot plead against the poor.â€ The eye of Noirtier beamed
with triumph.

â€œWhat do you decide on, sir?â€ asked the notary of Villefort.

â€œNothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know
he never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs
will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is
ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,
therefore, act according to my conscience.â€

Having said this, Villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his
father at liberty to do as he pleased. The same day the will was made,
the witnesses were brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in
the presence of all and given in charge to M. Deschamps, the family
notary.



 Chapter 60. The Telegraph

M. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of
Monte Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been
ushered into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there.
Madame de Villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her
late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately,
retired to her bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend
upon himself, proceeded at once to the salon.

Although M. de Villefort flattered himself that, to all outward view,
he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind,
he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so much
so that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his
sombre and thoughtful air.

â€œ_Ma foi!_â€ said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over,
â€œwhat is the matter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the
moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?â€

Villefort tried to smile.

â€œNo, count,â€ he replied, â€œI am the only victim in this case. It is I
who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have
caused it to be decided against me.â€

â€œTo what do you refer?â€ said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest.
â€œHave you really met with some great misfortune?â€

â€œOh, no, monsieur,â€ said Villefort with a bitter smile; â€œit is only a
loss of money which I have sustainedâ€”nothing worth mentioning, I assure
you.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œthe loss of a sum of money becomes almost
immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your
philosophic spirit.â€

â€œIt is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,â€ said
Villefort, â€œthough, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but
I am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to
call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may
blast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old
man relapsed into second childhood.â€

30183m



â€œWhat do you say?â€ said the count; â€œ900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum
which might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of
all this annoyance?â€

â€œMy father, as I told you.â€

â€œM. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely
paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?â€

â€œYes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,
nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.
I left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating
his will to two notaries.â€

â€œBut to do this he must have spoken?â€

â€œHe has done better than thatâ€”he has made himself understood.â€

â€œHow was such a thing possible?â€

â€œBy the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you
perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.â€

â€œMy dear,â€ said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room,
â€œperhaps you exaggerate the evil.â€

â€œGood-morning, madame,â€ said the count, bowing.



Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most
gracious smiles.

â€œWhat is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?â€ demanded Monte
Cristo â€œand what incomprehensible misfortuneâ€”â€”â€

â€œIncomprehensible is the word!â€ interrupted the procureur, shrugging
his shoulders. â€œIt is an old manâ€™s caprice!â€

â€œAnd is there no means of making him revoke his decision?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Madame de Villefort; â€œand it is still entirely in the power
of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of
Valentine, to be altered in her favor.â€

The count, who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning
to speak in parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation,
and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward, who was
mischievously pouring some ink into the birdâ€™s water-glass.

â€œMy dear,â€ said Villefort, in answer to his wife, â€œyou know I have
never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I
ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my
nod. Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected in
my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child
should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained
for so many years. The Baron dâ€™Ã‰pinay was my friend, as you know, and
an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly
be arranged.â€

â€œDo you think,â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œthat Valentine is in league
with him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should
not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing
but the execution of a plan concerted between them.â€

â€œMadame,â€ said Villefort, â€œbelieve me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is
not so easily renounced.â€

â€œShe could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir,
since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a
convent.â€

â€œNever mind,â€ replied Villefort; â€œI say that this marriage _shall_ be
consummated.â€

â€œNotwithstanding your fatherâ€™s wishes to the contrary?â€ said Madame de
Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. â€œThat is a serious thing.â€

Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every
word that was said.

30185m



â€œMadame,â€ replied Villefort â€œI can truly say that I have always
entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural
feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral
superiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be
reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to
obey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting
the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his
anger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct
by such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect
toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary
deprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in my
determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his
side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz
dâ€™Ã‰pinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match
for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my
daughterâ€™s hand on whomever I please.â€

â€œWhat?â€ said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had
frequently solicited during this speech. â€œWhat? Do you say that M.
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to
marry M. le Baron Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œYes, sir, that is the reason,â€ said Villefort, shrugging his
shoulders.

â€œThe apparent reason, at least,â€ said Madame de Villefort.

â€œThe _real_ reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.â€

â€œBut I want to know in what way M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay can have displeased your
father more than any other person?â€

â€œI believe I know M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay,â€ said the count; â€œis he not the
son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron dâ€™Ã‰pinay by Charles
X.?â€

â€œThe same,â€ said Villefort.

â€œWell, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.â€

â€œHe is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier
to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in
their affection,â€ said Madame de Villefort.

â€œBut,â€ said Monte Cristo â€œdo you not know any cause for this hatred?â€

â€œAh, _ma foi!_ who is to know?â€

â€œPerhaps it is some political difference?â€

â€œMy father and the Baron dâ€™Ã‰pinay lived in the stormy times of which I
only saw the ending,â€ said Villefort.

â€œWas not your father a Bonapartist?â€ asked Monte Cristo; â€œI think I
remember that you told me something of that kind.â€

â€œMy father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,â€ said Villefort,
carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; â€œand the
senatorâ€™s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to
disguise the old man without in any degree changing him. When my father
conspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for
M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian
schemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities,
and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible
theories of The Mountain,â€”theories that never shrank from any means
that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œit is just as I thought; it was politics
which brought Noirtier and M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay into personal contact. Although
General dâ€™Ã‰pinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain
royalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one
evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited
on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?â€

Villefort looked at the count almost with terror.

â€œAm I mistaken, then?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œNo, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,â€ said Madame
de Villefort; â€œand it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M.
de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the
two children of these inveterate enemies.â€

â€œIt was a sublime and charitable thought,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œand the
whole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle
Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read
in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he
had just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and
prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile
he was so constantly in the habit of assuming.

â€œAlthough,â€ said Villefort, â€œit will be a serious thing for Valentine
to lose her grandfatherâ€™s fortune, I do not think that M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay will
be frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in
greater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice
everything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that
Valentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all
probability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, her
motherâ€™s parents, who both love her tenderly.â€

â€œAnd who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,â€
said Madame de Villefort; â€œbesides, they are to come to Paris in about
a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut
up with M. Noirtier.â€

The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love
and defeated ambition.

â€œBut it seems to me,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œand I must begin by asking
your pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits
Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose
father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against
this dear Edward.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it
is impossible to describe; â€œis it not unjustâ€”shamefully unjust? Poor
Edward is as much M. Noirtierâ€™s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if
she had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left
her all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her
grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.â€

The count listened and said no more.

â€œCount,â€ said Villefort, â€œwe will not entertain you any longer with our
family misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow
charitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my
lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have
the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and
feeling. M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum,
shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.â€

â€œHowever,â€ said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which
incessantly occupied her mind, â€œperhaps it would be better to explain
this unlucky affair to M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, in order to give him the
opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle
de Villefort.â€

â€œAh, that would be a great pity,â€ said Villefort.

â€œA great pity,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œUndoubtedly,â€ said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, â€œa
marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit
on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to
put an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M.
dâ€™Ã‰pinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than
ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a
decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.â€

â€œI agree with M. de Villefort,â€ said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on
Madame de Villefort; â€œand if I were sufficiently intimate with him to
allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told
M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all
possibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project
which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.â€

The procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife
slightly changed color.

â€œWell, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a counsellor
such as you are,â€ said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo.
â€œTherefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it
had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a thing as
a change in our original plans.â€

â€œSir,â€ said the count, â€œthe world, unjust as it is, will be pleased
with your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M.
dâ€™Ã‰pinay, even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry,
which he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a
family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and
fulfil a duty.â€

At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart.

â€œAre you going to leave us, count?â€ said Madame de Villefort.

â€œI am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of
your promise for Saturday.â€

â€œDid you fear that we should forget it?â€

â€œYou are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important
and urgent occupations.â€

â€œMy husband has given me his word, sir,â€ said Madame de Villefort; â€œyou
have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose,
and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has
everything to gain.â€

â€œAnd,â€ said Villefort, â€œis it at your house in the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es that
you receive your visitors?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œwhich is precisely the reason which renders
your kindness more meritorious,â€”it is in the country.â€

â€œIn the country?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhere is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?â€

â€œVery near, only half a league from the Barriers,â€”it is at Auteuil.â€

â€œAt Auteuil?â€ said Villefort; â€œtrue, Madame de Villefort told me you
lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in
what part of Auteuil do you reside?â€

â€œRue de la Fontaine.â€

â€œRue de la Fontaine!â€ exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; â€œat what
number?â€

â€œNo. 28.â€

â€œThen,â€ cried Villefort, â€œwas it you who bought M. de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s
house!â€

â€œDid it belong to M. de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€ demanded Monte Cristo.

â€œYes,â€ replied Madame de Villefort; â€œand, would you believe it,
countâ€”â€”â€

â€œBelieve what?â€

â€œYou think this house pretty, do you not?â€

â€œI think it charming.â€

â€œWell, my husband would never live in it.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ returned Monte Cristo, â€œthat is a prejudice on your part, M.
de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.â€

â€œI do not like Auteuil, sir,â€ said the procureur, making an evident
effort to appear calm.

â€œBut I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me
of the pleasure of your company, sir,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œNo, count,â€”I hopeâ€”I assure you I shall do my best,â€ stammered
Villefort.

â€œOh,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œI allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six
oâ€™clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall
thinkâ€”for how do I know to the contrary?â€”that this house, which has
remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition
or dreadful legend connected with it.â€

â€œI will come, count,â€”I will be sure to come,â€ said Villefort eagerly.

â€œThank you,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œnow you must permit me to take my
leave of you.â€

â€œYou said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,â€ said
Madame de Villefort, â€œand you were about to tell us why when your
attention was called to some other subject.â€

â€œIndeed madame,â€ said Monte Cristo: â€œI scarcely know if I dare tell you
where I am going.â€

â€œNonsense; say on.â€

â€œWell, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for
hours together.â€

â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œA telegraph. So now I have told my secret.â€

â€œA telegraph?â€ repeated Madame de Villefort.

â€œYes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on
a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every
direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I
assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could
not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should
be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the
distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting
at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at
the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of
volition on the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of
genii, sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult
sciences, until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination.
Now, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these
large insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find
under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with
cabals, factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned
that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for
twelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the
heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler,
or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him,
but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied,
black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At
length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and
to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors
when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of
string.â€

30191m



â€œAnd are you going there?â€

â€œI am.â€

â€œWhat telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or
of the observatory?â€

â€œOh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand
things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to
explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not
understand. _Ma foi!_ I should wish to keep my illusions concerning
insects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I
had formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either
of these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a
good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is
employed to work.â€

â€œYou are a singular man,â€ said Villefort.

â€œWhat line would you advise me to study?â€

â€œThe one that is most in use just at this time.â€

â€œThe Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?â€

â€œYes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain
to youâ€”â€”â€

â€œNo,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œsince, as I told you before, I do not wish to
comprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a
telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. DuchÃ¢tel,
or from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified
by two Greek words, _tÃªle_, _graphein_. It is the insect with black
claws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in
all its purity and all its importance.â€

â€œGo then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will
not be able to see anything.â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_ you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?â€

â€œYes; the road to Bayonne.â€

â€œAnd afterwards the road to ChÃ¢tillon?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBy the tower of MontlhÃ©ry, you mean?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThank you. Good-bye. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions
concerning the telegraph.â€

At the door the count was met by the two notaries, who had just
completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine, and who were
leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not
fail of redounding considerably to their credit.



 Chapter 61. How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His
 Peaches

Not on the same night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count
of Monte Cristo went out by the BarriÃ¨re dâ€™Enfer, taking the road to
OrlÃ©ans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the
telegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count
reached the tower of MontlhÃ©ry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the
highest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the
count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about
eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself
stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and
white flowers.

Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long
in finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened
with a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate
opened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet
long by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which
contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the
other by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.

No one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,
floral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed
up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have
been capable of telling strange things, if,â€”in addition to the menacing
ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,â€”it had also a
voice.

The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of
thick box, of many yearsâ€™ growth, and of a tone and color that would
have delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was
formed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a
walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.

Never had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been
honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was
paid to her in this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees
which formed the _parterre_, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor
were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so
destructive to plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not
because the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as
soot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides,
had natural humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately
supplied by artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of
the corners of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a
toad, who, from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two
opposite sides of the basin. There was not a blade of grass to be seen
in the paths, or a weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained
and watered her geraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, in her
porcelain _jardiniÃ¨re_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen
gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure.

Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the
string to the nail, and cast a look around.

â€œThe man at the telegraph,â€ said he, â€œmust either engage a gardener or
devote himself passionately to agriculture.â€

Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow
filled with leaves; the something rose, uttering an exclamation of
astonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty
years old, who was plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon
grape leaves. He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries,
which, on rising suddenly, he let fall from his hand.

â€œYou are gathering your crop, sir?â€ said Monte Cristo, smiling.

30193m



â€œExcuse me, sir,â€ replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; â€œI am
not up there, I know, but I have only just come down.â€

â€œDo not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,â€ said the
count; â€œgather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.â€

â€œI have ten left,â€ said the man, â€œfor here are eleven, and I had
twenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the
spring has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir.
This is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have
this year, you see, eleven, already pluckedâ€”twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here
last night, sirâ€”I am sure they were hereâ€”I counted them. It must be the
son of MÃ¨re Simon who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here
this morning. Ah, the young rascalâ€”stealing in a gardenâ€”he does not
know where that may lead him to.â€

â€œCertainly, it is wrong,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œbut you should take into
consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.â€

â€œOf course,â€ said the gardener, â€œbut that does not make it the less
unpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an
officer that I am detaining here.â€ And he glanced timidly at the
countâ€™s blue coat.

30197m



â€œCalm yourself, my friend,â€ said the count, with the smile which he
made at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed
only the kindliest feeling; â€œI am not an inspector, but a traveller,
brought here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to
lose your time.â€

â€œAh, my time is not valuable,â€ replied the man with a melancholy smile.
â€œStill it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but,
having received the signal that I might rest for an hourâ€ (here he
glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of
MontlhÃ©ry, even a sun-dial), â€œand having ten minutes before me, and my
strawberries being ripe, when a day longerâ€”by-the-by, sir, do you think
dormice eat them?â€

â€œIndeed, I should think not,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œdormice are bad
neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.â€

â€œWhat? Did the Romans eat them?â€ said the gardenerâ€”â€œate dormice?â€

â€œI have read so in Petronius,â€ said the count.

â€œReally? They canâ€™t be nice, though they do say â€˜as fat as a dormouse.â€™
It is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day, and only waking to
eat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricotsâ€”they stole one, I
had one nectarine, only oneâ€”well, sir, they ate half of it on the wall;
a splendid nectarineâ€”I never ate a better.â€

â€œYou ate it?â€

â€œThat is to say, the half that was leftâ€”you understand; it was
exquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels;
like MÃ¨re Simonâ€™s son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But
this year,â€ continued the horticulturist, â€œIâ€™ll take care it shall not
happen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch
when the strawberries are ripe.â€

Monte Cristo had seen enough. Every man has a devouring passion in his
heart, as every fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was
horticulture. He began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the
sun from the grapes, and won the heart of the gardener.

â€œDid you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?â€ he said.

â€œYes, if it isnâ€™t contrary to the rules.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ said the gardener; â€œnot in the least, since there is no
danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying.â€

â€œI have been told,â€ said the count, â€œthat you do not always yourselves
understand the signals you repeat.â€

â€œThat is true, sir, and that is what I like best,â€ said the man,
smiling.

â€œWhy do you like that best?â€

â€œBecause then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and
nothing else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.â€

â€œIs it possible,â€ said Monte Cristo to himself, â€œthat I can have met
with a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans.â€

â€œSir,â€ said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, â€œthe ten minutes
are almost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with me?â€

â€œI follow you.â€

Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into three stories.
The tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes, watering-pots,
hung against the wall; this was all the furniture. The second was the
manâ€™s conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it contained a few
poor articles of household furnitureâ€”a bed, a table, two chairs, a
stone pitcherâ€”and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling, which the
count recognized as sweet peas, and of which the good man was
preserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he
had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.

â€œDoes it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?â€ asked
Monte Cristo.

â€œThe study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that
was so tedious.â€

â€œAnd what is the pay?â€

â€œA thousand francs, sir.â€

â€œIt is nothing.â€

â€œNo; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.â€

Monte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was
the telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles
by which the machine was worked. â€œIt is very interesting,â€ he said,
â€œbut it must be very tedious for a lifetime.â€

â€œYes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end
of a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of
recreation, and our holidays.â€

â€œHolidays?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhen?â€

â€œWhen we have a fog.â€

â€œAh, to be sure.â€

â€œThose are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I
prune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long.â€

â€œHow long have you been here?â€

â€œTen years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.â€

â€œYou areâ€”â€”â€

â€œFifty-five years old.â€

â€œHow long must you have served to claim the pension?â€

â€œOh, sir, twenty-five years.â€

â€œAnd how much is the pension?â€

â€œA hundred crowns.â€

â€œPoor humanity!â€ murmured Monte Cristo.

â€œWhat did you say, sir?â€ asked the man.

â€œI was saying it was very interesting.â€

â€œWhat was?â€

â€œAll you were showing me. And you really understand none of these
signals?â€

â€œNone at all.â€

â€œAnd have you never tried to understand them?â€

â€œNever. Why should I?â€

â€œBut still there are some signals only addressed to you.â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œAnd do you understand them?â€

â€œThey are always the same.â€

â€œAnd they meanâ€”â€”â€

â€œâ€˜_Nothing new; You have an hour;_â€™ or â€˜_Tomorrow_.â€™â€

â€œThis is simple enough,â€ said the count; â€œbut look, is not your
correspondent putting itself in motion?â€

â€œAh, yes; thank you, sir.â€

â€œAnd what is it sayingâ€”anything you understand?â€

â€œYes; it asks if I am ready.â€

â€œAnd you reply?â€

â€œBy the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand
correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand
correspondent to prepare in his turn.â€

â€œIt is very ingenious,â€ said the count.

â€œYou will see,â€ said the man proudly; â€œin five minutes he will speak.â€

â€œI have, then, five minutes,â€ said Monte Cristo to himself; â€œit is more
time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a
question?â€

â€œWhat is it, sir?â€

â€œYou are fond of gardening?â€

â€œPassionately.â€

â€œAnd you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty
feet, an enclosure of two acres?â€

â€œSir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it.â€

â€œYou live badly on your thousand francs?â€

â€œBadly enough; but yet I do live.â€

â€œYes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.â€

â€œTrue, the garden is not large.â€

â€œAnd, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat
everything.â€

â€œAh, they are my scourges.â€

â€œTell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your
right-hand correspondent was telegraphingâ€”â€”â€

â€œI should not see him.â€

â€œThen what would happen?â€

â€œI could not repeat the signals.â€

â€œAnd then?â€

â€œNot having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined.â€

â€œHow much?â€

â€œA hundred francs.â€

â€œThe tenth of your incomeâ€”that would be fine work.â€

â€œAh!â€ said the man.

â€œHas it ever happened to you?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œOnce, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.â€

â€œWell, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?â€

â€œAh, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my
pension.â€

â€œThree hundred francs?â€

â€œA hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any
of these things.â€

â€œNot even for fifteen yearsâ€™ wages? Come, it is worth thinking about?â€

â€œFor fifteen thousand francs?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œSir, you alarm me.â€

â€œNonsense.â€

â€œSir, you are tempting me?â€

â€œJust so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?â€

â€œSir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.â€

â€œOn the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.â€

â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œWhat? Do you not know these bits of paper?â€

â€œBank-notes!â€

â€œExactly; there are fifteen of them.â€

â€œAnd whose are they?â€

â€œYours, if you like.â€

â€œMine?â€ exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.

â€œYes; yoursâ€”your own property.â€

â€œSir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.â€

â€œLet him signal.â€

â€œSir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.â€

â€œThat will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to
take my bank-notes.â€

â€œSir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is
impatient.â€

â€œNever mindâ€”take these;â€ and the count placed the packet in the manâ€™s
hands. â€œNow this is not all,â€ he said; â€œyou cannot live upon your
fifteen thousand francs.â€

â€œI shall still have my place.â€

â€œNo, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondentâ€™s
message.â€

â€œOh, sir, what are you proposing?â€

â€œA jest.â€

â€œSir, unless you force meâ€”â€”â€

â€œI think I can effectually force you;â€ and Monte Cristo drew another
packet from his pocket. â€œHere are ten thousand more francs,â€ he said,
â€œwith the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make
twenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty little
house with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring
you in a thousand francs a year.â€

â€œA garden with two acres of land!â€

â€œAnd a thousand francs a year.â€

â€œOh, heavens!â€

â€œCome, take them,â€ and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his
hand.

â€œWhat am I to do?â€

â€œNothing very difficult.â€

â€œBut what is it?â€

â€œTo repeat these signs.â€ Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket,
upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order
in which they were to be worked.

â€œThere, you see it will not take long.â€

â€œYes; butâ€”â€”â€

â€œDo this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.â€

The shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his
brow, the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by
the count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand
correspondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the
gardener had gone mad. As to the left-hand one, he conscientiously
repeated the same signals, which were finally transmitted to the
Minister of the Interior.

â€œNow you are rich,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œYes,â€ replied the man, â€œbut at what a price!â€

â€œListen, friend,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œI do not wish to cause you any
remorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have wronged no
man, but on the contrary have benefited mankind.â€

The man looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale,
then red, then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water, but he
had no time to reach the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his
dried herbs. Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister,
Debray had the horses put to his carriage, and drove to Danglarsâ€™
house.

â€œHas your husband any Spanish bonds?â€ he asked of the baroness.

â€œI think so, indeed! He has six millionsâ€™ worth.â€

â€œHe must sell them at whatever price.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain.â€

30203m



â€œHow do you know?â€ Debray shrugged his shoulders.

â€œThe idea of asking how I hear the news,â€ he said.

The baroness did not wait for a repetition; she ran to her husband, who
immediately hastened to his agent, and ordered him to sell at any
price. When it was seen that Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell
directly. Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs; but he rid
himself of all his Spanish shares. The same evening the following was
read in _Le Messager_:

â€œ[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of his
guardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian
frontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.â€

All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,
who had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only
lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept
their shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as
ruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning _Le Moniteur_
contained the following:

â€œIt was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced
the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don
Carlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of
profound peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to
the fog, was the cause of this error.â€

The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,
reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference
of a million to Danglars.

â€œGood,â€ said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house when the news
arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been
the victim, â€œI have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand
francs, for which I would have paid a hundred thousand.â€

â€œWhat have you discovered?â€ asked Morrel.

â€œI have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that
eat his peaches.â€



 Chapter 62. Ghosts

At first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no
indications of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined
residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity
was according to the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing
to be altered outside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before
the door opened, the scene changed.

M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing,
and in the rapidity with which it was executed. It is told that the Duc
dâ€™Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed
Louis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court
with poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of
the house, and in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones,
half hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid
down, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For the rest, the
orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to
Bertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted, and the
shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the
paving-stones.

Thus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself
declared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a framework
of trees. The overseer would not have objected, while he was about it,
to have made some improvements in the garden, but the count had
positively forbidden it to be touched. Bertuccio made amends, however,
by loading the antechambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces with
flowers.

What, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the
profound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of
the other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so
sad and gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy
to be the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of
life, was scented with its masterâ€™s favorite perfumes, and had the very
light regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had
under his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite
pictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the
antechamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with
their music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the
sleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses
we have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them,
we leave a part of our souls.

The servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard; some, belonging to
the kitchens, gliding down the stairs, restored but the previous day,
as if they had always inhabited the house; others filling the
coach-houses, where the equipages, encased and numbered, appeared to
have been installed for the last fifty years; and in the stables the
horses replied with neighs to the grooms, who spoke to them with much
more respect than many servants pay their masters.

The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and
contained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely
devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the
day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red
and gold binding.

On the other side of the house, to match with the library, was the
conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in china jars;
and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to sight and
smell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned
during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth.

One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio.
Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by
the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio
with terror.

At five oâ€™clock precisely, the count arrived before the house at
Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with
impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments,
while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte Cristo
descended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without giving
any sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his bedroom,
situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a
little piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had noticed at a
previous visit.

â€œThat can only be to hold gloves,â€ he said.

â€œWill your excellency deign to open it?â€ said the delighted Bertuccio,
â€œand you will find gloves in it.â€

Elsewhere the count found everything he requiredâ€”smelling-bottles,
cigars, knick-knacks.

30207m



â€œGood,â€ he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so
powerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who
surrounded him.

At precisely six oâ€™clock the clatter of horsesâ€™ hoofs was heard at the
entrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who had arrived on MÃ©dÃ©ah.
â€œI am sure I am the first,â€ cried Morrel; â€œI did it on purpose to have
you a minute to myself, before everyone came. Julie and Emmanuel have a
thousand things to tell you. Ah, really this is magnificent! But tell
me, count, will your people take care of my horse?â€

â€œDo not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilianâ€”they understand.â€

â€œI mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he
cameâ€”like the wind!â€

â€œI should think so,â€”a horse that cost 5,000 francs!â€ said Monte Cristo,
in the tone which a father would use towards a son.

â€œDo you regret them?â€ asked Morrel, with his open laugh.

â€œI? Certainly not,â€ replied the count. â€œNo; I should only regret if the
horse had not proved good.â€

â€œIt is so good, that I have distanced M. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, one of the
best riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the ministerâ€™s
Arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars,
who always go at six leagues an hour.â€

â€œThen they follow you?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œSee, they are here.â€ And at the same minute a carriage with smoking
horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate,
which opened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the
steps, followed by the horsemen.

The instant Debray had touched the ground, he was at the carriage-door.
He offered his hand to the baroness, who, descending, took it with a
peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo. But
nothing escaped the countâ€™s notice, and he observed a little note,
passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice, from the
hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministerâ€™s secretary.

After his wife the banker descended, as pale as though he had issued
from his tomb instead of his carriage.

Madame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be
interpreted by Monte Cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle,
and across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion,
which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her
color, she ascended the steps, saying to Morrel:

â€œSir, if you were a friend of mine, I should ask you if you would sell
your horse.â€

Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned
round to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his
embarrassment. The count understood him.

â€œAh, madame,â€ he said, â€œwhy did you not make that request of me?â€

â€œWith you, sir,â€ replied the baroness, â€œone can wish for nothing, one
is so sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrelâ€”â€”â€

â€œUnfortunately,â€ replied the count, â€œI am witness that M. Morrel cannot
give up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œHe laid a wager he would tame MÃ©dÃ©ah in the space of six months. You
understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time
named, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was
afraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to gratify
a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred
obligations in the world.â€

â€œYou see my position, madame,â€ said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile
on Monte Cristo.

â€œIt seems to me,â€ said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a
forced smile, â€œthat you have already got horses enough.â€

Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed,
but, to the surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it,
and said nothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and
showed her two immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants,
of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness
was astonished.

â€œWhy,â€ said she, â€œyou could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the
Tuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?â€

â€œAh! madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œyou must not ask of us, the
manufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work of
another age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.â€

â€œHow so?â€”at what period can that have been?â€

â€œI do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven
built expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were
successively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten
were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing
what was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them
with coral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by
two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a
revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and
only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their
descent into the sea. At the end of two hundred years the documents
were found, and they thought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended
in machines, made expressly on the discovery, into the bay where they
were thrown; but of ten three only remained, the rest having been
broken by the waves. I am fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps,
misshapen, frightful monsters have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in
which myriads of small fish have slept, seeking a refuge from the
pursuit of their enemies.â€

Meanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was
mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one
after another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at
the cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,
pricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though
awaking from a dream.

â€œSir,â€ said Monte Cristo to him, â€œI do not recommend my pictures to
you, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are
two by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael,
a Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.â€

â€œStay,â€ said Debray; â€œI recognize this Hobbema.â€

â€œAh, indeed!â€

â€œYes; it was proposed for the Museum.â€

â€œWhich, I believe, does not contain one?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œNo; and yet they refused to buy it.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œYou pretend not to know,â€”because government was not rich enough.â€

â€œAh, pardon me,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œI have heard of these things
every day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them
yet.â€

â€œYou will, by and by,â€ said Debray.

â€œI think not,â€ replied ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œMajor Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,â€ announced
Baptistin.

A black satin stock, fresh from the makerâ€™s hands, gray moustaches, a
bold eye, a majorâ€™s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five
crossesâ€”in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldierâ€”such was the
appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom
we are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely new
clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son,
whom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On the
entrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to son, and
then, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began
criticising.

â€œCavalcanti!â€ said Debray.

â€œA fine name,â€ said Morrel.

â€œYes,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œthese Italians are well named and badly
dressed.â€

â€œYou are fastidious, ChÃ¢teau-Renaud,â€ replied Debray; â€œthose clothes
are well cut and quite new.â€

â€œThat is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be well
dressed for the first time in his life.â€

â€œWho are those gentlemen?â€ asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.

â€œYou heardâ€”Cavalcanti.â€

â€œThat tells me their name, and nothing else.â€

â€œAh! true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all
descended from princes.â€

â€œHave they any fortune?â€

â€œAn enormous one.â€

â€œWhat do they do?â€

â€œTry to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think, from
what they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them
here today on your account. I will introduce you to them.â€

â€œBut they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,â€ said
Danglars.

â€œThe son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near
Marseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic.â€

â€œUpon what subject?â€ asked Madame Danglars.

â€œThe French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife from
Paris.â€

â€œA fine idea that of his,â€ said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any
other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she
controlled herself.

â€œThe baron appears thoughtful today,â€ said Monte Cristo to her; â€œare
they going to put him in the ministry?â€

â€œNot yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse,
and has lost money.â€

â€œM. and Madame de Villefort,â€ cried Baptistin.

They entered. M. de Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was
visibly affected, and when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it
tremble.

â€œCertainly, women alone know how to dissimulate,â€ said Monte Cristo to
himself, glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur,
and embracing his wife.

After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who, until then, had been
occupied on the other side of the house, glide into an adjoining room.
He went to him.

â€œWhat do you want, M. Bertuccio?â€ said he.

â€œYour excellency has not stated the number of guests.â€

â€œAh, true.â€

â€œHow many covers?â€

â€œCount for yourself.â€

â€œIs everyone here, your excellency?â€

â€œYes.â€

Bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched
him. â€œGood heavens!â€ he exclaimed.

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ said the count.

â€œThat womanâ€”that woman!â€

â€œWhich?â€

â€œThe one with a white dress and so many diamondsâ€”the fair one.â€

â€œMadame Danglars?â€

â€œI do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!â€

â€œWhom do you mean?â€

â€œThe woman of the garden!â€”she that was _enceinte_â€”she who was walking
while she waited forâ€”â€”â€

Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair
on end.

â€œWaiting for whom?â€ Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort
with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo.

â€œOh, oh!â€ he at length muttered, â€œdo you see?â€

â€œWhat? Who?â€

â€œHim!â€

â€œHim!â€”M. de Villefort, the kingâ€™s attorney? Certainly I see him.â€

â€œThen I did not kill him?â€

â€œReally, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio,â€ said the count.

â€œThen he is not dead?â€

30213m



â€œNo; you see plainly he is not dead. Instead of striking between the
sixth and seventh left ribs, as your countrymen do, you must have
struck higher or lower, and life is very tenacious in these lawyers, or
rather there is no truth in anything you have told meâ€”it was a fright
of the imagination, a dream of your fancy. You went to sleep full of
thoughts of vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had
the nightmareâ€”thatâ€™s all. Come, calm yourself, and reckon them upâ€”M.
and Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M. de
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti, eight.â€

â€œEight!â€ repeated Bertuccio.

â€œStop! You are in a shocking hurry to be offâ€”you forget one of my
guests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,
the young man in a black coat, looking at Murilloâ€™s â€˜Madonnaâ€™; now he
is turning.â€

This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had not a look
from Monte Cristo silenced him.

â€œBenedetto?â€ he muttered; â€œfatality!â€

â€œHalf-past six oâ€™clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio,â€ said the count
severely; â€œI ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;â€
and he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the
wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards
the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing
said, with a violent effort, â€œThe dinner waits.â€

The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. â€œM.
de Villefort,â€ he said, â€œwill you conduct the Baroness Danglars?â€

Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.



 Chapter 63. The Dinner

It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering
the dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them
to this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they
still felt that they would not like to be absent. The recent events,
the solitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay,
almost incredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have
altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of
their own sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to
lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum.

And all present, even including Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding
the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other, were
thoughtful, on finding themselves assembled at the house of this
incomprehensible man. Madame Danglars had started when Villefort, on
the countâ€™s invitation, offered his arm; and Villefort felt that his
glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles, when he felt the arm of
the baroness press upon his own. None of this had escaped the count,
and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already
acquired considerable interest for an observer.

M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on his left
Morrel. The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars;
the other seats were filled by Debray, who was placed between the two
Cavalcanti, and by ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, seated between Madame de Villefort
and Morrel.

The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to
overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
appetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to
them, but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to
prepare. Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe
could provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare
birds, retaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread
upon massive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the
Archipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose
grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,â€”all
these, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his
guests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians,
who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a
dinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls,
like Cleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo deâ€™ Medici.

Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing and
joking about it.

â€œGentlemen,â€ he said, â€œyou will admit that, when arrived at a certain
degree of fortune, the superfluities of life are all that can be
desired; and the ladies will allow that, after having risen to a
certain eminence of position, the ideal alone can be more exalted. Now,
to follow out this reasoning, what is the marvellous?â€”that which we do
not understand. What is it that we really desire?â€”that which we cannot
obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot understand, to procure
impossibilities, these are the study of my life. I gratify my wishes by
two meansâ€”my will and my money. I take as much interest in the pursuit
of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new railway line;
you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you, M. Debray,
in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, in pleasing a woman;
and you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride. For example,
you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St.
Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples. Is it not amusing to
see them both on the same table?â€

â€œWhat are the two fish?â€ asked Danglars.

â€œM. ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of
one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of
the other.â€

â€œThis one is, I think, a sterlet,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.

â€œAnd that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.â€

â€œJust so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.â€

â€œSterlets,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œare only found in the Volga.â€

â€œAnd,â€ said Cavalcanti, â€œI know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies
lampreys of that size.â€

â€œExactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.â€

â€œImpossible!â€ cried all the guests simultaneously.

â€œWell, this is just what amuses me,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œI am like
Neroâ€”_cupitor impossibilium_; and that is what is amusing you at this
moment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no
better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it,
and here it is.â€

â€œBut how could you have these fish brought to France?â€

â€œOh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a caskâ€”one filled
with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they
were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe
me, M. Danglars!â€

â€œI cannot help doubting,â€ answered Danglars with his stupid smile.

â€œBaptistin,â€ said the count, â€œhave the other fish brought inâ€”the
sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks, and which are
yet alive.â€

Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands.
Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants, and in
each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.

â€œBut why have two of each sort?â€ asked Danglars.

â€œMerely because one might have died,â€ carelessly answered Monte Cristo.

â€œYou are certainly an extraordinary man,â€ said Danglars; â€œand
philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.â€

â€œAnd to have ideas,â€ added Madame Danglars.

â€œOh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans,
who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from
Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the
_mulus_, and which, from the description, must probably be the
goldfish. It was also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being
an amusing sight to see them die, for, when dying, they change color
three or four times, and like the rainbow when it disappears, pass
through all the prismatic shades, after which they were sent to the
kitchen. Their agony formed part of their meritâ€”if they were not seen
alive, they were despised when dead.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Debray, â€œbut then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œbut what would be the use of living
eighteen hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than he
could?â€

The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense
not to say anything.

â€œAll this is very extraordinary,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œstill, what I
admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude with which
your orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought this
house five or six days ago?â€

â€œCertainly not longer.â€

â€œWell, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I remember
rightly, it had another entrance, and the courtyard was paved and
empty; while today we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which
appear to be a hundred years old.â€

â€œWhy not? I am fond of grass and shade,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œYes,â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œthe door was towards the road before,
and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house
from the road, I remember.â€

â€œYes, madame,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œbut I preferred having an entrance
which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate.â€

â€œIn four days,â€ said Morrel; â€œit is extraordinary!â€

â€œIndeed,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œit seems quite miraculous to make a new
house out of an old one; for it was very old, and dull too. I recollect
coming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-MÃ©ran advertised it
for sale two or three years ago.â€

â€œM. de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€ said Madame de Villefort; â€œthen this house
belonged to M. de Saint-MÃ©ran before you bought it?â€

â€œIt appears so,â€ replied Monte Cristo.

â€œIs it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?â€

â€œQuite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.â€

â€œIt is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,â€ said
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œand it was quite melancholy to look at it, with the
blinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court. Really, if
the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one
might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had
been committed.â€

Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of
rare wine which were placed before him, here took one, and drank it
off. Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then said:

â€œIt is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first time
I came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my
steward had not taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the fellow
had been bribed by the notary.â€

â€œIt is probable,â€ stammered out Villefort, trying to smile; â€œbut I can
assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding. This
house is part of Valentineâ€™s marriage-portion, and M. de Saint-MÃ©ran
wished to sell it; for if it had remained another year or two
uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin.â€

It was Morrelâ€™s turn to become pale.

â€œThere was, above all, one room,â€ continued Monte Cristo, â€œvery plain
in appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to
me quite dramatic.â€

â€œWhy so?â€ said Danglars; â€œwhy dramatic?â€

â€œCan we account for instinct?â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œAre there not some
places where we seem to breathe sadness?â€”why, we cannot tell. It is a
chain of recollectionsâ€”an idea which carries you back to other times,
to other placesâ€”which, very likely, have no connection with the present
time and place. And there is something in this room which reminds me
forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona. Stay,
since we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will
take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.â€

Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort
rose, Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example.
Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to
their seats; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.

â€œDid you hear?â€ said Madame Danglars.

â€œWe must go,â€ replied Villefort, offering his arm.

The others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different
parts of the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to
the one room, and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of
the rest of the building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace.
Each one went out by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two
who remained; then, when they had passed, he brought up the rear, and
on his face was a smile, which, if they could have understood it, would
have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to
enter. They began by walking through the apartments, many of which were
fitted up in the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of
beds, and pipes instead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated
with the rarest pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with
draperies from China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and
wonderful texture. At length they arrived at the famous room. There was
nothing particular about it, excepting that, although daylight had
disappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in it was
old-fashioned, while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated. These
two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect.

â€œOh.â€ cried Madame de Villefort, â€œit is really frightful.â€

Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. Many
observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion
that there was something sinister about the room.

30221m



â€œIs it not so?â€ asked Monte Cristo. â€œLook at that large clumsy bed,
hung with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two crayon
portraits, that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say,
with their pale lips and staring eyes, â€˜We have seenâ€™?â€

Villefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed
near the chimney.

â€œOh,â€ said Madame de Villefort, smiling, â€œare you courageous enough to
sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was
committed?â€

Madame Danglars rose suddenly.

â€œAnd then,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œthis is not all.â€

â€œWhat is there more?â€ said Debray, who had not failed to notice the
agitation of Madame Danglars.

â€œAh, what else is there?â€ said Danglars; â€œfor, at present, I cannot say
that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you say, M.
Cavalcanti?â€

â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œwe have at Pisa, Ugolinoâ€™s tower; at Ferrara, Tassoâ€™s
prison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and Paolo.â€

â€œYes, but you have not this little staircase,â€ said Monte Cristo,
opening a door concealed by the drapery. â€œLook at it, and tell me what
you think of it.â€

â€œWhat a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud with a
smile.

â€œI do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but
certainly everything appears to me black in this house,â€ said Debray.

Ever since Valentineâ€™s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent
and sad.

â€œCan you imagine,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œsome Othello or AbbÃ© de Ganges,
one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step, carrying
a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not from
God?â€

Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was obliged
to support himself against the wall.

â€œAh, madame,â€ cried Debray, â€œwhat is the matter with you? how pale you
look!â€

â€œIt is very evident what is the matter with her,â€ said Madame de
Villefort; â€œM. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us,
doubtless intending to frighten us to death.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Villefort, â€œreally, count, you frighten the ladies.â€

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.

â€œNothing,â€ she replied with a violent effort. â€œI want air, that is
all.â€

â€œWill you come into the garden?â€ said Debray, advancing towards the
back staircase.

â€œNo, no,â€ she answered, â€œI would rather remain here.â€

â€œAre you really frightened, madame?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œOh, no, sir,â€ said Madame Danglars; â€œbut you suppose scenes in a
manner which gives them the appearance of reality.â€

30223m



â€œAh, yes,â€ said Monte Cristo smiling; â€œit is all a matter of
imagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest
mother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess
Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not
to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
carrying the sleeping child?â€

Here Madame Danglars, instead of being calmed by the soft picture,
uttered a groan and fainted.

â€œMadame Danglars is ill,â€ said Villefort; â€œit would be better to take
her to her carriage.â€

â€œOh, _mon Dieu!_â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œand I have forgotten my
smelling-bottle!â€

â€œI have mine,â€ said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to Monte
Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
properties the count had tested on Edward.

â€œAh,â€ said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.

â€œYes,â€ she said, â€œat your advice I have made the trial.â€

â€œAnd have you succeeded?â€

â€œI think so.â€

Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo
dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she
returned to consciousness.

â€œAh,â€ she cried, â€œwhat a frightful dream!â€

Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They
looked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in
poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major
Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte
Cristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and
conducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee
between the Cavalcanti.

â€œReally, madame,â€ he said, â€œdid I alarm you much?â€

â€œOh, no, sir,â€ she answered; â€œbut you know, things impress us
differently, according to the mood of our minds.â€ Villefort forced a
laugh.

â€œAnd then, you know,â€ he said, â€œan idea, a supposition, is sufficient.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œyou may believe me if you like, but it is
my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.â€

â€œTake care,â€ said Madame de Villefort, â€œthe kingâ€™s attorney is here.â€

â€œAh,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œsince that is the case, I will take
advantage of his presence to make my declaration.â€

â€œYour declaration?â€ said Villefort.

â€œYes, before witnesses.â€

â€œOh, this is very interesting,â€ said Debray; â€œif there really has been
a crime, we will investigate it.â€

â€œThere has been a crime,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œCome this way, gentlemen;
come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made
before the competent authorities.â€

He then took Villefortâ€™s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of
Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the
plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. All the other guests
followed.

â€œStay,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œhere, in this very spotâ€ (and he stamped
upon the ground), â€œI had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to
refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather,
the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a
newly born infant.â€

30225m



Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of
Villefort trembled.

â€œA newly born infant,â€ repeated Debray; â€œthis affair becomes serious!â€

â€œWell,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, â€œI was not wrong just now then, when I
said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors
carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because
it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.â€

â€œWho said it was a crime?â€ asked Villefort, with a last effort.

â€œHow? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?â€ cried
Monte Cristo. â€œAnd pray what do you call such an action?â€

â€œBut who said it was buried alive?â€

â€œWhy bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a
cemetery.â€

â€œWhat is done to infanticides in this country?â€ asked Major Cavalcanti
innocently.

â€œOh, their heads are soon cut off,â€ said Danglars.

â€œAh, indeed?â€ said Cavalcanti.

â€œI think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œYes, count,â€ replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.

Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,
said:

â€œCome, gentlemen,â€”some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,â€ and he
conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.

â€œIndeed, count,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œI am ashamed to own it, but all
your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me
sit down;â€ and she fell into a chair.

Monte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.

â€œI think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,â€ he said. But
before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had
found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, â€œI must speak to you.â€

â€œWhen?â€

â€œTomorrow.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œIn my office, or in the court, if you like,â€”that is the surest place.â€

â€œI will be there.â€

At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.

â€œThanks, my dear friend,â€ said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; â€œit is
over now, and I am much better.â€



 Chapter 64. The Beggar

The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return
to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding
the uneasiness she experienced. On his wifeâ€™s request, M. de Villefort
was the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his
landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his
wife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with
M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While
Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he
had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon
guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been
uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.
Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, ChÃ¢teau-Renaud,
and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefortâ€™s
carriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had
offered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury
waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the
English fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray
horse.

Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,
and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,
amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the kingâ€™s attorney. Then he
had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the
stiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into
consideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he
was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly
education of his heir. He contemplated with unspeakable delight the
large diamond which shone on the majorâ€™s little finger; for the major,
like a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his
bank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.
Then, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the
father and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son,
previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive
his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of
affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankerâ€™s
servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself
upon.

One thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the
veneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the
principle of Horace, _nil admirari_, had contented himself with showing
his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore,
concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the
illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed
upon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by
the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake
Fusaro, and the sterlet from the Volga. Thus it was with much
politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words:

â€œTomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on
business.â€

â€œAnd I, sir,â€ said Danglars, â€œshall be most happy to receive you.â€

Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the HÃ´tel
des Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his
son. To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his
son had lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and
carriages, and that not having come together, it would not be difficult
for them to leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by
the side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of
order and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to
allow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a
fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.

As for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom,
who, instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had
taken it to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking
thirty steps to reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the
bit of the impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held
out the reins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished
boot lightly on the step.

At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The young man turned round,
thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they
wished to tell him, and had returned just as they were starting. But
instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face,
sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles,
and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white
teeth, pointed and sharp as the wolfâ€™s or jackalâ€™s. A red handkerchief
encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large
bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they
would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the
young manâ€™s shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed
of gigantic size.

30229m



Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in
his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of
his interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he
shuddered and stepped back suddenly.

â€œWhat do you want of me?â€ he asked.

â€œPardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,â€ said the man with the red
handkerchief, â€œbut I want to speak to you.â€

â€œYou have no right to beg at night,â€ said the groom, endeavoring to rid
his master of the troublesome intruder.

â€œI am not begging, my fine fellow,â€ said the unknown to the servant,
with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile,
that he withdrew; â€œI only wish to say two or three words to your
master, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.â€

â€œCome,â€ said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to
perceive his agitation, â€œwhat do you want? Speak quickly, friend.â€

The man said, in a low voice: â€œI wishâ€”I wish you to spare me the walk
back to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a
dinner as you, I can scarcely stand.â€

The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity.

â€œTell me,â€ he saidâ€”â€œtell me what you want?â€

â€œWell, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry
me back.â€ Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.

â€œYes,â€ said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking
impudently at the youth; â€œI have taken the whim into my head; do you
understand, Master Benedetto?â€

At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went
towards his groom, saying:

â€œThis man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the
result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab,
that you may not be too late.â€

The surprised groom retired.

â€œLet me at least reach a shady spot,â€ said Andrea.

â€œOh, as for that, Iâ€™ll take you to a splendid place,â€ said the man with
the handkerchief; and taking the horseâ€™s bit he led the tilbury where
it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea
conferred upon him.

â€œDonâ€™t think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,â€ said
he; â€œoh, no, itâ€™s only because I am tired, and also because I have a
little business to talk over with you.â€

â€œCome, step in,â€ said the young man. It was a pity this scene had not
occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing
himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver
of the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village without
saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though
well-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.
Once out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself
that he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse
and crossing his arms before the man, he asked:

â€œNow, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?â€

â€œLet me ask you why you deceived me?â€

â€œHow have I deceived you?â€

â€œâ€˜How,â€™ do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you
were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that,
you come to Paris.â€

â€œHow does that annoy you?â€

â€œIt does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.â€

â€œSo,â€ said Andrea, â€œyou are speculating upon me?â€

â€œWhat fine words he uses!â€

â€œI warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.â€

â€œWell, well, donâ€™t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is to
be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you were
earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as _facchino_ or
_cicerone_, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own.
You know I always did call you my child.â€

â€œCome, come, what then?â€

â€œPatienceâ€”patience!â€

â€œI am patient, but go on.â€

â€œAll at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a
tilbury, and fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else
become a stockbroker.â€

â€œSo that, as you confess, you are jealous?â€

â€œNo, I am pleasedâ€”so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as
I am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might
not compromise you.â€

â€œYes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!â€ exclaimed Andrea; â€œyou
speak to me before my servant.â€

â€œHow can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you. You
have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as
an eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another
chance.â€

â€œYou see, I do not conceal myself.â€

â€œYou are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself;
and then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,â€ added
Caderousse with his unpleasant smile. â€œIt was very polite of you.â€

â€œCome,â€ said Andrea, â€œwhat do you want?â€

â€œYou do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that
is not rightâ€”take care, or I may become troublesome.â€

This menace smothered the young manâ€™s passion. He urged the horse again
into a trot.

â€œYou should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you
said just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I amâ€”â€”â€

â€œDo you know then now what you are?â€

â€œNo, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I am
young and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,
everything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune,
which has frowned on you, has been kind to me?â€

â€œFortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your
clothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better,â€ said
Caderousse, his eyes sparkling with avarice.

â€œOh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,â€ said Andrea,
becoming more and more excited. â€œIf I had been wearing a handkerchief
like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,
you would not have known me.â€

â€œYou wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being
as well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your
heart. If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to
divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Andrea.

â€œWhat an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ replied Andrea, laughing.

â€œHow did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have
just left?â€

â€œHe is not a prince; simply a count.â€

â€œA count, and a rich one too, eh?â€

â€œYes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not
a very good-tempered gentleman.â€

â€œOh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have him
all to yourself. But,â€ said Caderousse, again smiling with the
disagreeable expression he had before assumed, â€œyou must pay for itâ€”you
understand?â€

â€œWell, what do you want?â€

â€œI think that with a hundred francs a monthâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œI could liveâ€”â€”â€

â€œUpon a hundred francs!â€

â€œComeâ€”you understand me; but that withâ€”â€”â€

â€œWith?â€

â€œWith a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.â€

â€œHere are two hundred,â€ said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in
the hand of Caderousse.

30233m



â€œGood!â€ said Caderousse.

â€œApply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will
receive the same sum.â€

â€œThere now, again you degrade me.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œBy making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business
with you alone.â€

â€œWell, be it so, then. Take it from me then, and so long at least as I
receive my income, you shall be paid yours.â€

â€œCome, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing
when good fortune happens to such as you. But tell me all about it?â€

â€œWhy do you wish to know?â€ asked Cavalcanti.

â€œWhat? do you again defy me?â€

â€œNo; the fact is, I have found my father.â€

â€œWhat? a real father?â€

â€œYes, so long as he pays meâ€”â€”â€

â€œYouâ€™ll honor and believe himâ€”thatâ€™s right. What is his name?â€

â€œMajor Cavalcanti.â€

â€œIs he pleased with you?â€

â€œSo far I have appeared to answer his purpose.â€

â€œAnd who found this father for you?â€

â€œThe Count of Monte Cristo.â€

â€œThe man whose house you have just left?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,
since he holds the money-chest!â€

â€œWell, I will mention you to him. Meanwhile, what are you going to do?â€

â€œI?â€

â€œYes, you.â€

â€œIt is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.â€

â€œSince you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn
to ask you some questions.â€

â€œAh, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear a
decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a cafÃ©.
Then, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some
retired baker. That is what I want.â€

â€œCome, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,
nothing could be better.â€

â€œDo you think so, M. Bossuet? And youâ€”what will you become? A peer of
France?â€

â€œAh,â€ said Andrea, â€œwho knows?â€

â€œMajor Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is
abolished.â€

â€œNo politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and that
we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.â€

â€œNot at all, my good friend.â€

â€œHow? Not at all?â€

â€œWhy, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my
pocket, without reckoning what was there beforeâ€”making in all about two
hundred francs,â€”why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers.
Then, to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this
would cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without
giving due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of
the Mediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-bye to
my dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer
remaining honorably in the capital.â€

Andrea scowled. Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of
Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a
rapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his
pocket, where it began playing with a pistol. But, meanwhile,
Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off his companion, passed his
hand behind his back, and opened a long Spanish knife, which he always
carried with him, to be ready in case of need. The two friends, as we
see, were worthy of and understood one another. Andreaâ€™s hand left his
pocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it
played with for some time.

â€œGood Caderousse,â€ he said, â€œhow happy you will be.â€

â€œI will do my best,â€ said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting
up his knife.

â€œWell, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the
barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more
danger riding than on foot.â€

â€œWait,â€ said Caderousse, â€œwe shall see.â€ He then took the greatcoat
with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury,
and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcantiâ€™s hat, which he
placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude
of a servant whose master drives himself.

â€œBut, tell me,â€ said Andrea, â€œam I to remain bareheaded?â€

â€œPooh,â€ said Caderousse; â€œit is so windy that your hat can easily
appear to have blown off.â€

â€œCome, come; enough of this,â€ said Cavalcanti.

â€œWhat are you waiting for?â€ said Caderousse. â€œI hope I am not the
cause.â€

â€œHush,â€ said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident. At the
first cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.

â€œWell!â€ said Andrea,â€”â€œmy servantâ€™s coat and my hat?â€

â€œAh,â€ said Caderousse, â€œyou would not like me to risk taking cold?â€

â€œBut what am I to do?â€

â€œYou? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. _Au revoir_,
Benedetto;â€ and running into a court, he disappeared.

â€œAlas,â€ said Andrea, sighing, â€œone cannot be completely happy in this
world!â€



 Chapter 65. A Conjugal Scene

At the Place Louis XV. the three young people separatedâ€”that is to say,
Morrel went to the Boulevards, ChÃ¢teau-Renaud to the Pont de la
RÃ©volution, and Debray to the Quai. Most probably Morrel and
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud returned to their â€œdomestic hearths,â€ as they say in the
gallery of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of
the Rue Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with
Debray. When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the
left, galloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch,
and, issuing from the Rue de la MichodiÃ¨re, he arrived at M. Danglarsâ€™
door just at the same time that Villefortâ€™s landau, after having
deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©, stopped to
leave the baroness at her own house.

Debray, with the air of a man familiar with the house, entered first
into the court, threw his bridle into the hands of a footman, and
returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to whom he offered his
arm, to conduct her to her apartments. The gate once closed, and Debray
and the baroness alone in the court, he asked:

â€œWhat was the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at
that story, or rather fable, which the count related?â€

â€œBecause I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my
friend,â€ said the baroness.

â€œNo, Hermine,â€ replied Debray; â€œyou cannot make me believe that; on the
contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the
countâ€™s. M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much
you care for his ill-humor. Someone has vexed you; I will allow no one
to annoy you.â€

â€œYou are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,â€ replied Madame Danglars; â€œand
what I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you
remarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to.â€

It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous
irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to
themselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some
secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone. Being a man
who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent
penalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited
for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate
her, or receive an avowal _proprio motu_.

At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle CornÃ©lie,
her confidential maid.

â€œWhat is my daughter doing?â€ asked Madame Danglars.

â€œShe practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,â€ replied
Mademoiselle CornÃ©lie.

â€œYet I think I hear her piano.â€

â€œIt is Mademoiselle Louise dâ€™Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle
Danglars is in bed.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œcome and undress me.â€

They entered the bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch,
and Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle
CornÃ©lie.

â€œMy dear M. Lucien,â€ said Madame Danglars through the door, â€œyou are
always complaining that EugÃ©nie will not address a word to you.â€

â€œMadame,â€ said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him
as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, â€œI am not the only
one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he
could not extract a word from his betrothed.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Madame Danglars; â€œyet I think this will all pass off, and
that you will one day see her enter your study.â€

â€œMy study?â€

â€œAt least that of the minister.â€

â€œWhy so!â€

â€œTo ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an
infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of
fashion.â€

Debray smiled. â€œWell,â€ said he, â€œlet her come, with your consent and
that of the baron, and we will try and give her an engagement, though
we are very poor to pay such talent as hers.â€

â€œGo, CornÃ©lie,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œI do not require you any
longer.â€

CornÃ©lie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a
charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she
began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her
for a moment in silence.

â€œCome, Hermine,â€ he said, after a short time, â€œanswer
candidly,â€”something vexes youâ€”is it not so?â€

30239m



â€œNothing,â€ answered the baroness.

And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a
looking-glass. â€œI am frightful tonight,â€ she said. Debray rose,
smiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter
point, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray
reseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned
round, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no
trouble to conceal.

â€œGood-evening, madame,â€ said the banker; â€œgood-evening, M. Debray.â€

Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire
to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming
a dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her
husband.

â€œRead me something, M. Debray,â€ she said. Debray, who was slightly
disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of
the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife
inlaid with gold.

â€œExcuse me,â€ said the banker, â€œbut you will tire yourself, baroness, by
such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.â€

Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and
politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness
there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his
wife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her
astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon
her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where
he was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was,
that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.

â€œM. Lucien,â€ said the baroness, â€œI assure you I have no desire to
sleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening,
which you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.â€

â€œI am at your service, madame,â€ replied Lucien coldly.

â€œMy dear M. Debray,â€ said the banker, â€œdo not kill yourself tonight
listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as
well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will
allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.â€

This time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien
and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with
their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the
irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband
was victorious.

â€œDo not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,â€ continued
Danglars; â€œoh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to
ask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I
make such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.â€

Debray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against
the edge of the door, like Nathan in _Athalie_.

â€œIt is extraordinary,â€ he said, when the door was closed behind him,
â€œhow easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over
us.â€

30241m



Lucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the
open book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he
began playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as
Debray, and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of
his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The
animal uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its
destination, it crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such
unusual treatment remained silent and motionless.

â€œDo you know, sir,â€ asked the baroness, â€œthat you are improving?
Generally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.â€

â€œIt is because I am in a worse humor than usual,â€ replied Danglars.
Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances
frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took
no notice of them.

â€œAnd what have I to do with your ill-humor?â€ said the baroness,
irritated at the impassibility of her husband; â€œdo these things concern
me? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have
clerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.â€

â€œNot so,â€ replied Danglars; â€œyour advice is wrong, so I shall not
follow it. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M. Demoustier
says, and I will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My clerks
are honest men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their
deserts, if I may value them according to what they bring in; therefore
I shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in
a passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my
fortune.â€

â€œAnd pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain
yourself more clearly, I beg, sir.â€

â€œOh, make yourself easy!â€”I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon
know what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw
out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.â€

â€œI do not understand you, sir,â€ said the baroness, trying to disguise
the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.

â€œYou understand me perfectly, on the contrary,â€ said Danglars: â€œbut, if
you will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs
upon the Spanish loan.â€

â€œAnd pray,â€ asked the baroness, â€œam I responsible for this loss?â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œIs it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?â€

â€œCertainly it is not mine.â€

â€œOnce for all, sir,â€ replied the baroness sharply, â€œI tell you I will
not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the
house of my parents or in that of my first husband.â€

â€œOh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.â€

â€œThe better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the
bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that
noise of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and
re-counted, is odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more,
which is the sound of your voice.â€

â€œReally?â€ said Danglars. â€œWell, this surprises me, for I thought you
took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!â€

30243m



â€œI? What could put such an idea into your head?â€

â€œYourself.â€

â€œAh?â€”what next?â€

â€œMost assuredly.â€

â€œI should like to know upon what occasion?â€

â€œOh, _mon Dieu!_ that is very easily done. Last February you were the
first who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a ship had
entered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that a
payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how
clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as
many shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs
by it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as
you pleased; that was your business. In March there was a question
about a grant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each
offering equal securities. You told me that your instinct,â€”and although
you pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the
contrary, that your comprehension is very clear upon certain
affairs,â€”well, you told me that your instinct led you to believe the
grant would be given to the company called the Southern. I bought two
thirds of the shares of that company; as you had foreseen, the shares
trebled in value, and I picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs
were paid to you for pin-money. How have you spent this 250,000
francs?â€”it is no business of mine.â€

â€œWhen are you coming to the point?â€ cried the baroness, shivering with
anger and impatience.

â€œPatience, madame, I am coming to it.â€

â€œThatâ€™s fortunate.â€

â€œIn April you went to dine at the ministerâ€™s. You heard a private
conversation respecting Spanish affairsâ€”on the expulsion of Don Carlos.
I bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I pocketed
600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these
600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of
them according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not
the less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.â€

â€œWell, sir, and what then?â€

â€œAh, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.â€

â€œReally, your manner of speakingâ€”â€”â€

â€œIt expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days
after that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his
words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares,
the news got out, and I no longer soldâ€”I gave them away, next day I
find the news was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000
francs.â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWell, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a
fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.â€

â€œWhat you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debrayâ€™s name is mixed
up in this affair.â€

â€œBecause if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must
have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.â€

30245m



â€œFor shame!â€ exclaimed the baroness.

â€œOh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will
oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole
of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while he
smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful
players have never discoveredâ€”that is, a roulette where he wins without
playing, and is no loser when he loses.â€

The baroness became enraged.

â€œWretch!â€ she cried, â€œwill you dare to tell me you did not know what
you now reproach me with?â€

â€œI do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not know
it. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four
years that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it
has not always been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished
to study music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a
successful appearance at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Italien; at the same time I felt
inclined to learn dancing of the _danseuse_ who acquired such a
reputation in London. This cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000
francs. I said nothing, for we must have peace in the house; and
100,000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in
music and dancing are not too much. Well, you soon become tired of
singing, and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministerâ€™s
secretary. You understand, it signifies nothing to me so long as you
pay for your lessons out of your own cash box. But today I find you are
drawing on mine, and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700,000
francs per month. Stop there, madame, for this cannot last. Either the
diplomatist must give his lessons gratis, and I will tolerate him, or
he must never set his foot again in my house;â€”do you understand,
madame?â€

â€œOh, this is too much,â€ cried Hermine, choking, â€œyou are worse than
despicable.â€

â€œBut,â€ continued Danglars, â€œI find you did not even pause thereâ€”â€”â€

â€œInsults!â€

â€œYou are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I
have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me
in the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash box. Be it
so. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.
Besides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the
minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the
popular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin
me?â€

â€œA probable thing!â€

â€œWhy not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?â€”a false
telegraphic despatchâ€”it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be
made as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for
meâ€”I am sure of it.â€

â€œSir,â€ said the baroness humbly, â€œare you not aware that the man
employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with
him, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would
have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which
proves that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.â€

â€œYes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a
sleepless night, which has caused the ministerâ€™s secretaries to blacken
several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.â€

â€œBut, sir,â€ said Hermine suddenly, â€œif all this is, as you say, caused
by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell
me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?â€

â€œDo I know M. Debray?â€”do I wish to know him?â€”do I wish to know that he
gives advice?â€”do I wish to follow it?â€”do I speculate? No; you do all
this, not I.â€

â€œStill it seems to me, that as you profit by itâ€”â€”â€

Danglars shrugged his shoulders. â€œFoolish creature,â€ he exclaimed.
â€œWomen fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three
intrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had
even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the
commencement of the artâ€”for generally husbands _will_ not seeâ€”you would
then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the
women of the world. But it has not been so with me,â€”I see, and always
have seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden
a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,
while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you
had deceived me. What has been the result?â€”that, thanks to my pretended
ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.
Debray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not
treated me as the master of the house,â€”the only title I desire with
respect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to
speak of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make
me hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above
all, I forbid you to ruin me.â€

The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort
had been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if
touched by a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an
apparition; she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as
though to tear the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which
he withheld from some odious calculation,â€”odious, as all his
calculations were.

â€œM. de Villefort!â€”What do you mean?â€

â€œI mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a
philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was
nothing to be got out of a kingâ€™s attorney, died of grief or anger at
finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been _enceinte_
six. I am brutal,â€”I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of
the reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill
himself instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs
to my cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his
share of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become
bankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts doâ€”disappear.
He is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when it
is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than
he.â€

Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to
reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of
Villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes
which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and
changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous
debate.

Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. He
shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and
returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her
half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a
disagreeable dream.



 Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects

The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a
visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his _coupÃ©_ did not
appear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars
ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain,
watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he
should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two
oâ€™clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to
the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From
twelve to two oâ€™clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his
dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure
upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major
Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself
precisely at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business
with the banker.

On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of
agitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against
the ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive
to the Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, No. 30.

Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged
Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was
waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbÃ©
and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and
instead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments,
and disappeared.

A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and
Monte Cristo appeared.

â€œPardon me,â€ said he, â€œmy dear baron, but one of my friends, the AbbÃ©
Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not
having seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave
him sooner, so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made
you wait.â€

â€œNay,â€ said Danglars, â€œit is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a
wrong time, and will retire.â€

â€œNot at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with
you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a
capitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to
the world.â€

â€œI have been in ill-luck for several days,â€ said Danglars, â€œand I have
heard nothing but bad news.â€

â€œAh, indeed?â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œHave you had another fall at the
Bourse?â€

â€œNo; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a
bankrupt of Trieste.â€

â€œReally? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?â€

â€œExactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I
donâ€™t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during
the year. Never a mistake or delayâ€”a fellow who paid like a prince.
Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo
Manfredi suspends payment!â€

â€œReally?â€

â€œIt is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000 francs, my
bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of
exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his
correspondentâ€™s in Paris at the end of this month. Today is the 30th. I
present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my
Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.â€

â€œThen you really lost by that affair in Spain?â€

â€œYes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash boxâ€”nothing more!â€

â€œWhy, how could you make such a mistakeâ€”such an old stager?â€

â€œOh, it is all my wifeâ€™s fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to
Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she
dreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this conviction
I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she
speculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her own money, not
mine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave
the wifeâ€™s pocket, the husband always finds it out. But do you mean to
say you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a tremendous
noise.â€

â€œYes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no
one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.â€

30251m



â€œThen you do not speculate?â€

â€œI?â€”How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in
regulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep
a clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the
baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers
said something about it, did they not?â€

â€œThen you believe the papers?â€

â€œI?â€”not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest
_Messager_ was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced
telegraphic despatches.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s what puzzles me,â€ replied Danglars; â€œthe news of the
return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.â€

â€œSo that,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œyou have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs
this month.â€

â€œNot nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.â€

â€œ_Diable!_â€ said Monte Cristo compassionately, â€œit is a hard blow for a
third-rate fortune.â€

â€œThird-rate,â€ said Danglars, rather humble, â€œwhat do you mean by that?â€

â€œCertainly,â€ continued Monte Cristo, â€œI make three assortments in
fortuneâ€”first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those
first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under oneâ€™s
hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as
France, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property
form a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate
fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock
companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than
1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions;
finally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a
fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances
which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,
speculations of the dayâ€”in fact, all operations under the influence of
greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious
capital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position,
is it not?â€

â€œConfound it, yes!â€ replied Danglars.

â€œThe result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce
the third-rate house to despair.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!â€

â€œLet us imagine seven such months,â€ continued Monte Cristo, in the same
tone. â€œTell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs
make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;â€”well, you are right, for
if you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your
principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized
man. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,â€”this is our
credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on
retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of
about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are
never more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive
on a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam
surrounding it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your
real capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of
course, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune;
to follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and
this if repeated three or four times will cause deathâ€”so pay attention
to it, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to
lend you some?â€

30253m



â€œWhat a bad calculator you are!â€ exclaimed Danglars, calling to his
assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. â€œI have made money at
the same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made up the
loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been
defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some
galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.â€

â€œVery good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the
first loss.â€

â€œNo, for I am only embarked in certainties,â€ replied Danglars, with the
air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; â€œto involve me, three
governments must crumble to dust.â€

â€œWell, such things have been.â€

â€œThat there should be a famine!â€

â€œRecollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.â€

â€œOr, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and
even then my vessels would become caravans.â€

â€œSo much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,â€ said
Monte Cristo; â€œI see I was deceived, and that you belong to the class
of second-rate fortunes.â€

â€œI think I may aspire to that honor,â€ said Danglars with a smile, which
reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond
of daubing into their pictures of ruins. â€œBut, while we are speaking of
business,â€ Danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing
the subject, â€œtell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti.â€

â€œGive him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation
seems good.â€

â€œExcellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000
francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you
to me, with your endorsementâ€”of course, I immediately counted him over
the forty bank-notes.â€

Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.

â€œBut that is not all,â€ continued Danglars; â€œhe has opened an account
with my house for his son.â€

â€œMay I ask how much he allows the young man?â€

â€œFive thousand francs per month.â€

â€œSixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing
that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon
5,000 francs a month?â€

â€œBut you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands
moreâ€”â€”â€

â€œDo not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know
these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom
were they recommended to you?â€

â€œOh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.â€

â€œI do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold
to the terms of the agreement.â€

â€œWould you not trust the Cavalcanti?â€

â€œI? oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature. I was only
speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning
just now.â€

â€œAnd with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken him
for anything more than a mere major.â€

â€œAnd you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has no
manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old
lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the
Italians are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not
glittering in Oriental splendor.â€

â€œThe young man is better,â€ said Danglars.

â€œYes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared
tolerable. I was uneasy about him.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the
world, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe
tutor, and had never been to Paris before.â€

â€œAh, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?â€ asked
Danglars carelessly; â€œthey like to unite their fortunes.â€

â€œIt is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing
like other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son
to France to choose a wife.â€

â€œDo you think so?â€

â€œI am sure of it.â€

â€œAnd you have heard his fortune mentioned?â€

â€œNothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and
others that he did not possess a farthing.â€

â€œAnd what is your opinion?â€

â€œI ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal
impression.â€

â€œWell, and it is thatâ€”â€”â€

â€œMy opinion is, that all these old _podestÃ s_, these ancient
_condottieri_,â€”for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed
provinces,â€”my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions
in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their
eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and
the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the
florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have
become reflected in them.â€

â€œCertainly,â€ said Danglars, â€œand this is further supported by the fact
of their not possessing an inch of land.â€

â€œVery little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,
excepting his palace in Lucca.â€

â€œAh, he has a palace?â€ said Danglars, laughing; â€œcome, that is
something.â€

â€œYes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while
he lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the old
fellow is very close.â€

â€œCome, you do not flatter him.â€

â€œI scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my life;
all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was
telling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant
in Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in
France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that
though I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for
this.â€

â€œNever mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a
fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of
it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is
merely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do
they give them any fortune?â€

â€œOh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as
a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons
married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they
married against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month.
Should Andrea marry according to his fatherâ€™s views, he will, perhaps,
give him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were
the daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the
father-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the
major takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would
be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling
cards or rattling the dice.â€

â€œAh, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will
want a crown, an El Dorado, and PotosÃ­.â€

â€œNo; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry
into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do
you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so
many questions?â€

â€œ_Ma foi_,â€ said Danglars, â€œit would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,
and you know I am a speculator.â€

â€œYou are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not
like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?â€

â€œAlbert,â€ repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; â€œah, well; he
would care very little about it, I think.â€

â€œBut he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?â€

â€œWell, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame
de Morcerf and Albertâ€”â€”â€

â€œYou do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?â€

â€œIndeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de
Morcerf.â€

â€œMademoiselle Danglarsâ€™ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if
the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.â€

â€œOh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell meâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œWhy did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?â€

â€œI did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being
obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.â€

â€œYes, yes,â€ said Danglars, laughing, â€œit would do her a great deal of
good.â€

â€œWhy so?â€

â€œBecause it is the air she always breathed in her youth.â€

Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.

â€œBut still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,â€ said
the count, â€œyou must allow that he has a fine name?â€

â€œSo he has; but I like mine as well.â€

â€œCertainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have
adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according
to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which
dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon
twenty years.â€

â€œAnd for this very reason,â€ said Danglars with a smile, which he tried
to make sardonic, â€œI prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de
Morcerf.â€

â€œStill, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?â€

â€œThe Morcerfs!â€”Stay, my dear count,â€ said Danglars; â€œyou are a man of
the world, are you not?â€

â€œI think so.â€

â€œAnd you understand heraldry?â€

â€œA little.â€

â€œWell, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerfâ€™s.â€

â€œWhy so?â€

â€œBecause, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least,
Danglars.â€

â€œWell, what then?â€

â€œWhile his name is not Morcerf.â€

â€œHow?â€”not Morcerf?â€

â€œNot the least in the world.â€

â€œGo on.â€

â€œI have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a
count, so that he is not one at all.â€

â€œImpossible!â€

â€œListen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my
acquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the
most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.â€

â€œA proof of great humility or great pride,â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œWell, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.â€

â€œAnd then he was calledâ€”â€”â€

â€œFernand.â€

â€œOnly Fernand?â€

â€œFernand Mondego.â€

â€œYou are sure?â€

â€œ_Pardieu!_ I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.â€

â€œThen, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?â€

â€œBecause Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become
noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have
been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œOh, nothing!â€

â€œAh, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of
Fernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.â€

â€œIn conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?â€

â€œExactly so.â€

â€œThis is the mystery,â€ said Danglars. â€œI acknowledge I would have given
anything to find it out.â€

â€œIt would be very easy if you much wished it?â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œProbably you have some correspondent in Greece?â€

â€œI should think so.â€

â€œAt Yanina?â€

â€œEverywhere.â€

â€œWell, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was
played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali
Tepelini.â€

â€œYou are right,â€ exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, â€œI will write
today.â€

â€œDo so.â€

â€œI will.â€

30259m



â€œAnd if you should hear of anything very scandalousâ€”â€”â€

â€œI will communicate it to you.â€

â€œYou will oblige me.â€

Danglars rushed out of the room, and made but one leap into his
_coupÃ©_.



 Chapter 67. The Office of the Kingâ€™s Attorney

Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and
follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at
half-past twelve oâ€™clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and
had left home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the
Faubourg Saint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the
Passage du Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She
was very plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste
walking in the morning. At the Rue GuÃ©nÃ©gaud she called a cab, and
directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was
seated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black
veil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the
bonnet, and saw with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her
white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed
the Pont-Neuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the
driver was paid as the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs
Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.

There was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like
persons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention
to women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any
more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer.

There was a great press of people in M. de Villefortâ€™s antechamber, but
Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant
she appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether
she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment;
and on her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a
private passage to M. de Villefortâ€™s office.

The magistrate was seated in an armchair, writing, with his back
towards the door; he did not move as he heard it open, and the
door-keeper pronounce the words, â€œWalk in, madame,â€ and then reclose
it; but no sooner had the manâ€™s footsteps ceased, than he started up,
drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and examined every corner of the
room. Then, when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen
nor heard, and was consequently relieved of doubts, he said:

â€œThanks, madame,â€”thanks for your punctuality;â€ and he offered a chair
to Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart beat so violently
that she felt nearly suffocated.

30261m



â€œIt is a long time, madame,â€ said the procureur, describing a
half-circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite to
Madame Danglars,â€”â€œit is a long time since I had the pleasure of
speaking alone with you, and I regret that we have only now met to
enter upon a painful conversation.â€

â€œNevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal, although
certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for
you.â€ Villefort smiled bitterly.

â€œIt is true, then,â€ he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than
addressing his companion,â€”â€œit is true, then, that all our actions leave
their tracesâ€”some sad, others brightâ€”on our paths; it is true that
every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the
sands;â€”it leaves its track! Alas, to many the path is traced by tears.â€

â€œSir,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œyou can feel for my emotion, can you not?
Spare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this room,â€”whence so many
guilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look at
that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,â€”oh, it
requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman
and you a menacing judge.â€

Villefort dropped his head and sighed.

â€œAnd I,â€ he said, â€œI feel that my place is not in the judgeâ€™s seat, but
on the prisonerâ€™s bench.â€

30263m



â€œYou?â€ said Madame Danglars.

â€œYes, I.â€

â€œI think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,â€ said Madame Danglars,
whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. â€œThe paths of which you
were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent
imaginations. Besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the
indulgence of our passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear
from all this? the world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.â€

â€œMadame,â€ replied Villefort, â€œyou know that I am no hypocrite, or, at
least, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it
is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified,
it is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in
my youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all
seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since then
everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave
difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own
free will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with
me in my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently
desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it,
or from whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a
manâ€™s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of
necessity; then, after error has been committed in a moment of
excitement, of delirium, or of fear, we see that we might have avoided
and escaped it. The means we might have used, which we in our blindness
could not see, then seem simple and easy, and we say, â€˜Why did I not do
this, instead of that?â€™ Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented
with remorse; for the decision does not come from you,â€”your misfortunes
are generally imposed upon you, and your faults the results of othersâ€™
crimes.â€

â€œIn any case, sir, you will allow,â€ replied Madame Danglars, â€œthat,
even if the fault were alone mine, I last night received a severe
punishment for it.â€

â€œPoor thing,â€ said Villefort, pressing her hand, â€œit was too severe for
your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yetâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWell, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not yet
heard all.â€

â€œAh,â€ exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, â€œwhat is there more to hear?â€

â€œYou only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough. Well,
picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillâ€”certainly frightful,
perhaps sanguinary!â€

The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was, and his present
excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream,
but the sound died in her throat.

â€œHow has this terrible past been recalled?â€ cried Villefort; â€œhow is it
that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our
hearts, where it was buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening
our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame?â€

â€œAlas,â€ said Hermine, â€œdoubtless it is chance.â€

â€œChance?â€ replied Villefort; â€œNo, no, madame, there is no such thing as
chance.â€

â€œOh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by
chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by
chance he caused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the
unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees?â€”that poor innocent
offspring of mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many,
many tears. Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear
spoil found beneath the flowers.â€

â€œWell, no, madame,â€”this is the terrible news I have to tell you,â€ said
Villefort in a hollow voiceâ€”â€œno, nothing was found beneath the flowers;
there was no child disinterredâ€”no. You must not weep, no, you must not
groan, you must tremble!â€

â€œWhat can you mean?â€ asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.

â€œI mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found
neither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!â€

â€œNeither of them there?â€ repeated Madame Danglars, her staring,
wide-open eyes expressing her alarm. â€œNeither of them there!â€ she again
said, as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the
words which escaped her.

â€œNo,â€ said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, â€œno, a hundred
times no!â€

â€œThen you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive
me? Where did you place it? tell meâ€”where?â€

â€œThere! But listen to meâ€”listenâ€”and you will pity me who has for twenty
years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,
without casting the least portion upon you.â€

â€œOh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.â€

â€œYou recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed
in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,
awaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to meâ€”motionless,
breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.â€

Madame Danglars moved rapidly, as though she would spring from her
chair, but Villefort stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore
her attention.

â€œWe thought it dead,â€ he repeated; â€œI placed it in the chest, which was
to take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole,
and then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth,
when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow
rise, and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to
cry out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I
fell lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your
sublime courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged
myself to the foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came
to meet me. We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful
catastrophe. You had the fortitude to regain the house, assisted by
your nurse. A duel was the pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely
expected it, our secret remained in our own keeping alone. I was taken
to Versailles; for three months I struggled with death; at last, as I
seemed to cling to life, I was ordered to the South. Four men carried
me from Paris to ChÃ¢lons, walking six leagues a day; Madame de
Villefort followed the litter in her carriage. At ChÃ¢lons I was put
upon the SaÃ´ne, thence I passed on to the RhÃ´ne, whence I descended,
merely with the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again placed on my
litter, and continued my journey to Marseilles. My recovery lasted six
months. I never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire for
you. When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de
Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.

â€œWhat was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness
returned to me? Always the sameâ€”always the childâ€™s corpse, coming every
night in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave
with menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to
Paris; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had
just been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I
disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifeâ€™s father and mother
should pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for
cancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given
10,000â€”I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the
tenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so
much wanted, I galloped to Auteuil. No one had entered the house since
I had left it.

â€œIt was five oâ€™clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room,
and waited for night. There all the thoughts which had disturbed me
during my year of constant agony came back with double force. The
Corsican, who had declared the vendetta against me, who had followed me
from NÃ®mes to Paris, who had hid himself in the garden, who had struck
me, had seen me dig the grave, had seen me inter the child,â€”he might
become acquainted with your person,â€”nay, he might even then have known
it. Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?
Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not
died from the blow of his dagger? It was therefore necessary, before
everything else, and at all risks, that I should cause all traces of
the past to disappearâ€”that I should destroy every material vestige; too
much reality would always remain in my recollection. It was for this I
had annulled the leaseâ€”it was for this I had comeâ€”it was for this I was
waiting.

â€œNight arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a
light in that room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I
continually expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed
everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not
turn around. My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would
open. At length, one by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased.
I understood that I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen
nor heard, so I decided upon descending to the garden.

â€œListen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I
drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found
in my coatâ€”that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you
wished to have fastened to a golden ringâ€”when I opened the door, and
saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral
staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly
shrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I
descended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not
conquer was a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if
I had relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the
lower door. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I
took it, and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a
dark lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I
continued my path.

â€œIt was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had
disappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long
bony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My
terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that I
took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually
that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined
the thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully
around; I was indeed alone,â€”no noise disturbed the silence but the owl,
whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night. I
tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the
precise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.

â€œThe grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when
autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where
the grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had
turned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had
been waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,
how I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some
resistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a
hole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceivedâ€”had
mistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to
recall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind
whistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my
forehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the
ground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a
laburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a
resting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,
relaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On
my right I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same
attitude, and threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and
enlarging the hole; still I found nothing, nothingâ€”the chest was no
longer there!â€

30269m



â€œThe chest no longer there?â€ murmured Madame Danglars, choking with
fear.

â€œThink not I contented myself with this one effort,â€ continued
Villefort. â€œNo; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,
having discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had
intended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another
hole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea
struck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply
thrown it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to
renew my search. I remained in the room and waited.â€

â€œOh, Heaven!â€

30271m



When daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the
thicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the
darkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty
feet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in
a day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothingâ€”absolutely
nothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,
it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this
examination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I
returned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.â€

â€œOh,â€ cried Madame Danglars, â€œit was enough to drive you mad!â€

â€œI hoped for a moment that it might,â€ said Villefort; â€œbut that
happiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,
â€˜Why,â€™ said I, â€˜should that man have carried away the corpse?â€™â€

â€œBut you said,â€ replied Madame Danglars, â€œhe would require it as a
proof.â€

â€œAh, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;
they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing
of the kind has happened.â€

â€œWhat then?â€ asked Hermine, trembling violently.

â€œSomething more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for usâ€”the child
was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!â€

Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefortâ€™s hands,
exclaimed, â€œMy child was alive?â€ said she; â€œyou buried my child alive?
You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ahâ€”â€”â€

Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands
she wrung in her feeble grasp.

â€œI know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,â€
replied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful
mind was on the verge of despair and madness.

â€œAh, my child, my poor child!â€ cried the baroness, falling on her
chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort, becoming
somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm
gathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the
terror he felt.

â€œYou understand, then, that if it were so,â€ said he, rising in his
turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone,
â€œwe are lost. This child lives, and someone knows it livesâ€”someone is
in possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of
a child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who
is in possession of our secret.â€

â€œJust God, avenging God!â€ murmured Madame Danglars.

Villefortâ€™s only answer was a stifled groan.

â€œBut the childâ€”the child, sir?â€ repeated the agitated mother.

â€œHow I have searched for him,â€ replied Villefort, wringing his hands;
â€œhow I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed
for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of
men, and to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for the
hundredth time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what
the Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a
fugitive; perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it
into the river.â€

â€œImpossible!â€ cried Madame Danglars: â€œa man may murder another out of
revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.â€

â€œPerhaps,â€ continued Villefort, â€œhe had put it in the foundling
hospital.â€

â€œOh, yes, yes,â€ cried the baroness; â€œmy child is there!â€

â€œI ran to the hospital, and learned that the same nightâ€”the night of
the 20th of Septemberâ€”a child had been brought there, wrapped in part
of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the
napkin was marked with half a baronâ€™s crown, and the letter H.â€

â€œTruly, truly,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œall my linen is marked thus;
Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine. Thank God, my
child was not then dead!â€

â€œNo, it was not dead.â€

â€œAnd you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is
the child?â€

Villefort shrugged his shoulders.

â€œDo I know?â€ said he; â€œand do you believe that if I knew I would relate
to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a
novel writer? Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after,
came to claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all
the requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.â€

â€œBut you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced
her.â€

â€œAnd what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and
employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of
her. They traced her to ChÃ¢lons, and there they lost her.â€

â€œThey lost her?â€

â€œYes, forever.â€

Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh, a tear, or a
shriek for every detail. â€œAnd this is all?â€ said she; â€œand you stopped
there?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ said Villefort; â€œI never ceased to search and to inquire.
However, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.
But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since
fear urges me, not my conscience.â€

â€œBut,â€ replied Madame Danglars, â€œthe Count of Monte Cristo can know
nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.â€

â€œOh, the wickedness of man is very great,â€ said Villefort, â€œsince it
surpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that manâ€™s eyes while he
was speaking to us?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œBut have you ever watched him carefully?â€

â€œDoubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck
me,â€”of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched
nothing. I might have suspected he was poisoning us.â€

â€œAnd you see you would have been deceived.â€

â€œYes, doubtless.â€

â€œBut believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I wished
to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against everyone, but
especially against him. Tell me,â€ cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more
steadfastly on her than he had ever done before, â€œdid you ever reveal
to anyone our connection?â€

â€œNever, to anyone.â€

â€œYou understand me,â€ replied Villefort, affectionately; â€œwhen I say
anyone,â€”pardon my urgency,â€”to anyone living I mean?â€

â€œYes, yes, I understand very well,â€ ejaculated the baroness; â€œnever, I
swear to you.â€

â€œWere you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had
transpired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?â€

â€œNo, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself.â€

â€œDo you talk in your sleep?â€

30275m



â€œI sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?â€

The color mounted to the baronessâ€™s face, and Villefort turned awfully
pale.

â€œIt is true,â€ said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard.

â€œWell?â€ said the baroness.

â€œWell, I understand what I now have to do,â€ replied Villefort. â€œIn less
than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte
Cristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in our
presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden.â€

Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made
the count shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the
baroness reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the
door. Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the
other side of which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping
peacefully on his box while waiting for her.



 Chapter 68. A Summer Ball

The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the
procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed
through the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the
door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her sonâ€™s
arm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his
toilet, drove to the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, to the house of Monte Cristo.

The count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing
that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that manâ€™s favor. Those
who would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an
impassable barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was
chilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply
held out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his
invariable practice.

â€œHere I am, dear count.â€

â€œWelcome home again.â€

â€œI arrived an hour since.â€

â€œFrom Dieppe?â€

â€œNo, from TrÃ©port.â€

â€œIndeed?â€

â€œAnd I have come at once to see you.â€

â€œThat is extremely kind of you,â€ said Monte Cristo with a tone of
perfect indifference.

â€œAnd what is the news?â€

â€œYou should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.â€

â€œI know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for
me?â€

â€œHad you commissioned me?â€ said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.

â€œCome, come,â€ said Albert, â€œdo not assume so much indifference. It is
said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at TrÃ©port, I felt the
electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.â€

â€œPossibly,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œI have indeed thought of you, but the
magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.â€

30277m



â€œIndeed! Pray tell me how it happened.â€

â€œWillingly. M. Danglars dined with me.â€

â€œI know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.â€

â€œBut he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.â€

â€œYour Italian prince?â€

â€œNot so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.â€

â€œCalls himself, do you say?â€

â€œYes, calls himself.â€

â€œIs he not a count?â€

â€œWhat can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him
the same title, and everyone else does likewise.â€

â€œWhat a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined
here?â€

â€œYes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars,
M. and Madame de Villefort,â€”charming people,â€”M. Debray, Maximilian
Morrel, and M. de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.â€

â€œDid they speak of me?â€

â€œNot a word.â€

â€œSo much the worse.â€

â€œWhy so? I thought you wished them to forget you?â€

â€œIf they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am
in despair.â€

â€œHow will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among
the number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of
you at home.â€

â€œI have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in
which I think of her.â€

â€œTouching sympathy! So you hate each other?â€ said the count.

â€œListen,â€ said Morcerfâ€”â€œif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take
pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with
all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to
agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a
charming mistressâ€”but a wifeâ€”_diable!_â€

â€œAnd this,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œis your opinion of your intended
spouse?â€

â€œYes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this
dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my
lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens
me. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,â€”good heavens! There she
must always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.â€

â€œYou are difficult to please, viscount.â€

â€œYes, for I often wish for what is impossible.â€

â€œWhat is that?â€

â€œTo find such a wife as my father found.â€

Monte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some
magnificent pistols.

â€œYour father was fortunate, then?â€ said he.

â€œYou know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,â€”still beautiful,
witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with
his mother for four days at TrÃ©port, it would have been a condescension
or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peacefulâ€”shall I
say more poetic!â€”than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my
companion.â€

30279m



â€œThat is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone vow
to live a single life.â€

â€œSuch are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars.
Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we
obtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at
MarlÃ©â€™s or Fossinâ€™s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but
if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and
still must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we
have to endure?â€

â€œWorldling,â€ murmured the count.

â€œThus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie perceives I am but a
pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has
millions.â€ Monte Cristo smiled. â€œOne plan occurred to me,â€ continued
Albert; â€œFranz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in
love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written
in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: â€˜My eccentricity
may be great, but it will not make me break my promise.â€™â€

â€œThat is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one
whom you would not marry yourself.â€ Albert smiled.

â€œApropos,â€ continued he, â€œFranz is coming soon, but it will not
interest you; you dislike him, I think?â€

â€œI?â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œmy dear viscount, how have you discovered that
I did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.â€

â€œAnd you include me in the expression everyoneâ€”many thanks!â€

â€œLet us not mistake,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œI love everyone as God
commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate
but a few. Let us return to M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay. Did you say he was
coming?â€

â€œYes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get
Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle
EugÃ©nie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a
grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise oneâ€™s
pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.â€

â€œBut M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.â€

â€œStill more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie,
and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and
Madame de Villefort.â€

â€œWhich they deserve, do they not?â€

â€œI believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but
a just man.â€

â€œThere is, then, one,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œwhom you do not condemn like
poor Danglars?â€

â€œBecause I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,â€ replied
Albert, laughing.

â€œIndeed, my dear sir,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œyou are revoltingly
foppish.â€

â€œI foppish? how do you mean?â€

â€œYes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle
to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course;
perhaps you may not have to retract.â€

â€œBah!â€ said Albert, staring.

â€œDoubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and
seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?â€

â€œI would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.â€

â€œThen make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum
to attain the same end.â€

â€œAm I, indeed, so happy?â€ said Albert, who still could not prevent an
almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. â€œBut, my dear
count, has M. Danglars any reason?â€

â€œAh! there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the
self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is
attacked with a needle.â€

â€œBut yet, M. Danglars appearedâ€”â€”â€

â€œDelighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is
still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for
yourself.â€

â€œThank you, I understand. But my motherâ€”no, not my mother; I mistakeâ€”my
father intends giving a ball.â€

â€œA ball at this season?â€

â€œSummer balls are fashionable.â€

â€œIf they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would
become so.â€

â€œYou are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain in
Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our
invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?â€

â€œWhen will it take place?â€

â€œOn Saturday.â€

â€œM. Cavalcantiâ€™s father will be gone.â€

â€œBut the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?â€

â€œI do not know him, viscount.â€

â€œYou do not know him?â€

â€œNo, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for
him.â€

â€œBut you receive him at your house?â€

â€œThat is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbÃ©, who
may be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to
present him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you
would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,â€”besides, I
may not be there myself.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œAt your ball.â€

â€œWhy should you not be there?â€

â€œBecause you have not yet invited me.â€

â€œBut I come expressly for that purpose.â€

â€œYou are very kind, but I may be prevented.â€

â€œIf I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all
impediments.â€

â€œTell me what it is.â€

â€œMy mother begs you to come.â€

â€œThe Comtesse de Morcerf?â€ said Monte Cristo, starting.

â€œAh, count,â€ said Albert, â€œI assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely
to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I
spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them,
for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.â€

â€œYou have talked of me?â€

â€œYes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!â€

â€œThen I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too
reasonable to be led by imagination.â€

â€œA problem, my dear count, for everyoneâ€”for my mother as well as
others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do
not fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long
unsolved. I believe, while the Countess Gâ€”â€” takes you for Lord Ruthven,
my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The
first opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy
for you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the
other.â€

â€œI thank you for the warning,â€ said the count; â€œI shall endeavor to be
prepared for all suppositions.â€

â€œYou will, then, come on Saturday?â€

â€œYes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.â€

â€œYou are very kind.â€

â€œWill M. Danglars be there?â€

â€œHe has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the
great dâ€™Aguesseau,11 M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope
of seeing him.â€

â€œâ€˜Never despair of anything,â€™ says the proverb.â€

â€œDo you dance, count?â€

â€œI dance?â€

â€œYes, you; it would not be astonishing.â€

â€œThat is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I
like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?â€

â€œNever; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.â€

â€œIndeed?â€

30283m



â€œYes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have
heard her speak with interest.â€ Albert rose and took his hat; the count
conducted him to the door.

â€œI have one thing to reproach myself with,â€ said he, stopping Albert on
the steps. â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œI have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.â€

â€œOn the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.â€

â€œI am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect
M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œFive or six days hence at the latest.â€

â€œAnd when is he to be married?â€

â€œImmediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran.â€

â€œBring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you
I shall be happy to see him.â€

â€œI will obey your orders, my lord.â€

â€œGood-bye.â€

â€œUntil Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?â€

â€œYes, I promised you.â€ The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to
him. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing
Bertuccio, â€œWhat news?â€ said he.

â€œShe went to the Palais,â€ replied the steward.

â€œDid she stay long there?â€

â€œAn hour and a half.â€

â€œDid she return home?â€

â€œDirectly.â€

â€œWell, my dear Bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œI now advise you to go in
quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.â€

Bertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the
order he had received, he started the same evening.



 Chapter 69. The Inquiry

M. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to
endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the
history of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required
information to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of
prisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter
begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely
to give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de
Villefort received the following note:

â€œThe person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate
acquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen
in Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the AbbÃ©
Busoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has
done much good.â€

M. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made
respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the
following evening he received these details:

â€œThe abbÃ©, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small
two-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each
floor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a
dining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a
wainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was
evident that the abbÃ© limited himself to objects of strict necessity.
He preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library
than parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments,
in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according
to his valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a
sort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased
him, he replied that the abbÃ© was not in Paris, an answer which
satisfied most persons, because the abbÃ© was known to be a great
traveller. Besides, whether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo,
the abbÃ© always left something to give away, which the valet
distributed through this wicket in his masterâ€™s name. The other room
near the library was a bedroom. A bed without curtains, four armchairs,
and a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with a
_prie-Dieu_, all its furniture.

â€œLord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. He was one of
those English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He
hired the apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few
hours in the day there, and rarely slept there. One of his
peculiarities was never to speak a word of French, which he however
wrote with great facility.â€

The day after this important information had been given to the kingâ€™s
attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue
FÃ©rou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the AbbÃ© Busoni
were within.

â€œNo, he went out early this morning,â€ replied the valet.

â€œI might not always be content with that answer,â€ replied the visitor,
â€œfor I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the
kindness to give the AbbÃ© Busoniâ€”â€”â€

â€œI told you he was not at home,â€ repeated the valet.

â€œThen on his return give him that card and this sealed paper. Will he
be at home at eight oâ€™clock this evening?â€

â€œDoubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.â€

â€œI will come again at that time,â€ replied the visitor, who then
retired.

At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage,
which, instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue FÃ©rou, drove
up to the green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit
him. From the signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note
had produced a good effect.

â€œIs the abbÃ© at home?â€ asked he.

â€œYes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,â€ replied
the valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table,
illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while
the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the
abbÃ© in a monkâ€™s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by
learned men of the Middle Ages.

â€œHave I the honor of addressing the AbbÃ© Busoni?â€ asked the visitor.

â€œYes, sir,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œand you are the person whom M. de
Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect
of police?â€

â€œExactly, sir.â€

â€œOne of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?â€

â€œYes, sirâ€ replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.

The abbÃ© replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes
but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the
same. â€œI am at your service, sir,â€ said the abbÃ©, with a marked Italian
accent.

â€œThe mission with which I am charged, sir,â€ replied the visitor,
speaking with hesitation, â€œis a confidential one on the part of him who
fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.â€ The abbÃ© bowed. â€œYour
probity,â€ replied the stranger, â€œis so well known to the prefect that
he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars
connected with the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to
see you. It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration
will induce you to conceal the truth.â€

â€œProvided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my
scruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of
confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not
between me and human justice.â€

â€œDo not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your
conscience.â€

At this moment the abbÃ© pressed down his side of the shade and so
raised it on the other, throwing a bright light on the strangerâ€™s face,
while his own remained obscured.

â€œExcuse me, abbÃ©,â€ said the envoy of the prefect of the police, â€œbut
the light tries my eyes very much.â€ The abbÃ© lowered the shade.

â€œNow, sir, I am listeningâ€”go on.â€

â€œI will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte
Cristo?â€

â€œYou mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?â€

â€œZaccone?â€”is not his name Monte Cristo?â€

â€œMonte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not
a family name.â€

â€œWell, be it soâ€”let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte
Cristo and M. Zaccone are the sameâ€”â€”â€

â€œAbsolutely the same.â€

â€œLet us speak of M. Zaccone.â€

â€œAgreed.â€

â€œI asked you if you knew him?â€

â€œExtremely well.â€

â€œWho is he?â€

â€œThe son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.â€

â€œI know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not
content itself with vague reports.â€

â€œHowever,â€ replied the abbÃ©, with an affable smile, â€œwhen that report
is in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police
as well as all the rest.â€

â€œAre you sure of what you assert?â€

â€œWhat do you mean by that question?â€

â€œUnderstand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if
you are certain of it?â€

â€œI knew his father, M. Zaccone.â€

â€œAh, indeed?â€

â€œAnd when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.â€

â€œBut whence does he derive the title of count?â€

â€œYou are aware that may be bought.â€

â€œIn Italy?â€

â€œEverywhere.â€

â€œAnd his immense riches, whence does he procure them?â€

â€œThey may not be so very great.â€

â€œHow much do you suppose he possesses?â€

â€œFrom one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.â€

â€œThat is reasonable,â€ said the visitor; â€œI have heard he had three or
four millions.â€

â€œTwo hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.â€

â€œBut I was told he had four millions per annum.â€

â€œThat is not probable.â€

â€œDo you know this Island of Monte Cristo?â€

â€œCertainly, everyone who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to
France by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must
have seen it.â€

â€œI am told it is a delightful place?â€

â€œIt is a rock.â€

â€œAnd why has the count bought a rock?â€

â€œFor the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial
possessions to be a count.â€

â€œYou have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zacconeâ€™s youth?â€

â€œThe fatherâ€™s?â€

â€œNo, the sonâ€™s.â€

â€œI know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my
young comrade.â€

â€œWas he in the wars?â€

â€œI think he entered the service.â€

â€œIn what branch?â€

â€œIn the navy.â€

â€œAre you not his confessor?â€

â€œNo, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.â€

â€œA Lutheran?â€

â€œI say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides,
liberty of conscience is established in France.â€

â€œDoubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his
actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know
of him.

â€œHe passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has
made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the
Christians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from
Eastern monarchs of his services.â€

â€œDoes he wear them?â€

â€œNo, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given
to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers.â€

â€œHe is a Quaker then?â€

â€œExactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.â€

â€œHas he any friends?â€

â€œYes, everyone who knows him is his friend.â€

â€œBut has he any enemies?â€

â€œOne only.â€

â€œWhat is his name?â€

â€œLord Wilmore.â€

â€œWhere is he?â€

â€œHe is in Paris just now.â€

â€œCan he give me any particulars?â€

â€œImportant ones; he was in India with Zaccone.â€

â€œDo you know his abode?â€

â€œItâ€™s somewhere in the ChaussÃ©e dâ€™Antin; but I know neither the street
nor the number.â€

30289m



â€œAre you at variance with the Englishman?â€

â€œI love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.â€

â€œDo you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before
he made this visit to Paris?â€

â€œTo that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because
he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and as
I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.
Cavalcanti to him.â€

â€œAndrea?â€

â€œNo, Bartolomeo, his father.â€

â€œNow, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in
the name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me
candidly.â€

â€œWhat is it, sir?â€

â€œDo you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at
Auteuil?â€

â€œCertainly, for he told me.â€

â€œWhat is it, sir?â€

â€œTo make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count
of Pisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?â€

â€œI have heard of it.â€

â€œIt is a magnificent charity.â€ Having said this, the abbÃ© bowed to
imply he wished to pursue his studies.

The visitor either understood the abbÃ©â€™s meaning, or had no more
questions to ask; he arose, and the abbÃ© accompanied him to the door.

â€œYou are a great almsgiver,â€ said the visitor, â€œand although you are
said to be rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor
people; will you accept my offering?â€

â€œI thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the
relief I give should be entirely from my own resources.â€

â€œHoweverâ€”â€”â€

â€œMy resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for
yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to
exercise your benevolence.â€

The abbÃ© once more bowed as he opened the door, the stranger bowed and
took his leave, and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of
M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered, and
this time it went to the Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges, and stopped at No.
5, where Lord Wilmore lived. The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore,
requesting an interview, which the latter had fixed for ten oâ€™clock. As
the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten, he
was told that Lord Wilmore, who was precision and punctuality
personified, was not yet come in, but that he would be sure to return
as the clock struck.

The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all
other furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern SÃ¨vres
vases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with
an engraving on each sideâ€”one representing Homer carrying his guide,
the other, Belisarius beggingâ€”a grayish paper; red and black
tapestryâ€”such was the appearance of Lord Wilmoreâ€™s drawing-room.

It was illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a
feeble light, as if out of consideration for the envoyâ€™s weak sight.
After ten minutesâ€™ expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth
stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above
the middle height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and
light hair, turning rather gray. He was dressed with all the English
peculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar,
in the fashion of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen
pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps
from slipping up to the knee. His first remark on entering was:

â€œYou know, sir, I do not speak French?â€

â€œI know you do not like to converse in our language,â€ replied the
envoy.

â€œBut you may use it,â€ replied Lord Wilmore; â€œI understand it.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ replied the visitor, changing his idiom, â€œknow enough of
English to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the
slightest inconvenience.â€

â€œAw?â€ said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives
of Great Britain.

The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read
with English coolness, and having finished:

â€œI understand,â€ said he, â€œperfectly.â€

30293m



Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been
addressed to the AbbÃ© Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of
the countâ€™s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more
numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten
years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of
India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met
him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken
prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had
escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;
then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the
Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in
the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from
everyone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was
consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,
which was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord
Wilmoreâ€™s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per
annum,â€”a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the
failure of the mine.

â€œBut,â€ asked the visitor, â€œdo you know why he came to France?â€

â€œHe is speculating in railways,â€ said Lord Wilmore, â€œand as he is an
expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of
telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.â€

â€œHow much does he spend yearly?â€ asked the prefect.

â€œNot more than five or six hundred thousand francs,â€ said Lord Wilmore;
â€œhe is a miser.â€ Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing
no other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.

â€œDo you know his house at Auteuil?â€

â€œCertainly.â€

â€œWhat do you know respecting it?â€

â€œDo you wish to know why he bought it?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThe count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in
experiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he
has bought a mineral spring equal to those at BagnÃ¨res, Luchon, and
Cauterets. He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_, as the
Germans term it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three
times to find the famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon
purchase all the contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his
railway, his electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin
him, I am watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.â€

â€œWhat was the cause of your quarrel?â€

â€œWhen he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.â€

â€œWhy do you not seek revenge?â€

â€œI have already fought three duels with him,â€ said the Englishman, â€œthe
first with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with
the sabre.â€

â€œAnd what was the result of those duels?â€

â€œThe first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the
breast; and the third time, made this large wound.â€ The Englishman
turned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved
it to be a recent one. â€œSo that, you see, there is a deadly feud
between us.â€

â€œBut,â€ said the envoy, â€œyou do not go about it in the right way to kill
him, if I understand you correctly.â€

â€œAw?â€ said the Englishman, â€œI practice shooting every day, and every
other day Grisier comes to my house.â€

This was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the
Englishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord
Wilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the
English, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after
him, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his
light hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume
the black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte
Cristo.

It was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the house
of M. de Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he had
learned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since the
dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.



 Chapter 70. The Ball

It was in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the
Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de
Morcerfâ€™s. It was ten oâ€™clock at night; the branches of the great trees
in the garden of the countâ€™s house stood out boldly against the azure
canopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where the
last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered.

From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of
music, with the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams
of light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this
moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just
received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity
of the weather continuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided
whether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a
long tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with
stars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn.

The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the
Italian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the
tableâ€”the rarest of all luxuries in their complete formâ€”are well
understood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers.

At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
count; for, owing to the good taste of MercÃ©dÃ¨s, one was sure of
finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even
copying in case of need.

Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had caused deep
anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerfâ€™s, when during
the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort. The latter
made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together, said:

â€œYou are going to Madame de Morcerfâ€™s, are you not?â€

â€œNo,â€ replied Madame Danglars, â€œI am too ill.â€

â€œYou are wrong,â€ replied Villefort, significantly; â€œit is important
that you should be seen there.â€

â€œDo you think so?â€ asked the baroness.

â€œI do.â€

â€œIn that case I will go.â€

And the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations.
Madame Danglars therefore came, not only beautiful in person, but
radiant with splendor; she entered by one door at the time when
MercÃ©dÃ¨s appeared at the door. The countess took Albert to meet Madame
Danglars. He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her
toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat. Albert looked
around him.

â€œYou are looking for my daughter?â€ said the baroness, smiling.

â€œI confess it,â€ replied Albert. â€œCould you have been so cruel as not to
bring her?â€

â€œCalm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken
her arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell meâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell, what do you wish to know?â€

â€œWill not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight?â€

â€œSeventeen!â€ replied Albert.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

â€œI only mean that the count seems the rage,â€ replied the viscount,
smiling, â€œand that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the
same question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.â€

â€œAnd have you replied to everyone as you have to me?â€

â€œAh, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have
this â€˜lionâ€™; we are among the privileged ones.â€

â€œWere you at the Opera yesterday?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œHe was there.â€

â€œAh, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?â€

â€œCan he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in _Le Diable
boiteux_; the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he
placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to the
charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift,
reappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,â€”will she be
here?â€

â€œNo, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the countâ€™s
establishment is not sufficiently understood.â€

â€œWait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is
trying to attract your attention.â€

Albert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de
Villefort, whose lips opened as he approached.

â€œI wager anything,â€ said Albert, interrupting her, â€œthat I know what
you were about to say.â€

â€œWell, what is it?â€

â€œIf I guess rightly, will you confess it?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œOn your honor?â€

â€œOn my honor.â€

â€œYou were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or
was expected.â€

â€œNot at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to
ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.â€

â€œYes,â€”yesterday.â€

â€œWhat did he tell you?â€

â€œThat he was leaving at the same time as his letter.â€

â€œWell, now then, the count?â€

â€œThe count will come, of that you may be satisfied.â€

â€œYou know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?â€

â€œNo, I did not know it.â€

â€œMonte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.â€

â€œI never heard it.â€

â€œWell, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.â€

â€œIt is possible.â€

â€œHe is a Maltese.â€

â€œThat is also possible.

â€œThe son of a shipowner.â€

â€œReally, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest
success.â€

â€œHe served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris
to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™m sure,â€ said Morcerf, â€œthis is indeed news! Am I allowed to
repeat it?â€

â€œYes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told
you.â€

â€œWhy so?â€

â€œBecause it is a secret just discovered.â€

â€œBy whom?â€

â€œThe police.â€

â€œThen the news originatedâ€”â€”â€

â€œAt the prefectâ€™s last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished
at the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made
inquiries.â€

â€œWell, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a
vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.â€

â€œIndeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not
been so favorable.â€

â€œPoor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?â€

â€œI think not.â€

â€œThen it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will
not fail to do so.â€

Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and
glossy moustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert
extended his hand.

â€œMadame,â€ said Albert, â€œallow me to present to you M. Maximilian
Morrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all, of our
bravest officers.â€

â€œI have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil,
at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,â€ replied Madame de
Villefort, turning away with marked coldness of manner.

This answer, and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled
the heart of poor Morrel. But a recompense was in store for him;
turning around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large
blue eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while
the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips.

The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same
expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these
two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble
aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room,
forgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their
mutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one
another, without anyone noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte
Cristo had just entered.

We have already said that there was something in the count which
attracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the
coat, unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was
not the plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed
the foot so perfectly formedâ€”it was none of these things that attracted
the attention,â€”it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his
calm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth,
chiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such
high disdain,â€”these were what fixed the attention of all upon him.

Many men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none
whose appearance was more _significant_, if the expression may be used.
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant
habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to
the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture,
scarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that
even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected
with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.

Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery
of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a
mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a
looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive
him. She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he
was bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her,
while on his side the count thought she was about to address him; but
both remained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his
steps to Albert, who received him cordially.

â€œHave you seen my mother?â€ asked Albert.

â€œI have just had the pleasure,â€ replied the count; â€œbut I have not seen
your father.â€

â€œSee, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of
great geniuses.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œand so those gentlemen down there are men
of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of
talent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.â€

â€œThat tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the
neighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than
lizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the
Institute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided
in his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the
learned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion
of Honor, was made an officer.â€

â€œCome,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œthis cross seems to me to be wisely
awarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they
would have made him a commander.â€

â€œVery likely,â€ said Albert.

â€œAnd who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap
himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?â€

â€œOh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republicâ€™s, which deputed
David12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œso this gentleman is an Academician?â€

â€œWithin the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.â€

â€œAnd what is his especial talent?â€

â€œHis talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he
makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with
whalebone.â€

â€œAnd he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?â€

â€œNo; of the French Academy.â€

â€œBut what has the French Academy to do with all this?â€

â€œI was going to tell you. It seemsâ€”â€”â€

â€œThat his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of
science, doubtless?â€

â€œNo; that his style of writing is very good.â€

â€œThis must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose
heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and
to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?â€

Albert laughed.

â€œAnd the other one?â€ demanded the count.

â€œThat one?â€

â€œYes, the third.â€

â€œThe one in the dark blue coat?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHe is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents
to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was
very successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal
papers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now
getting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an
ambassador.â€

30303m



â€œAnd what are his claims to the peerage?â€

â€œHe has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five
articles in the _SiÃ¨cle_, and voted five or six years on the
ministerial side.â€

â€œBravo, viscount,â€ said Monte Cristo, smiling; â€œyou are a delightful
_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?â€

â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œDo not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish
it, you will warn me.â€ Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He
turned round; it was Danglars.

â€œAh! is it you, baron?â€ said he.

â€œWhy do you call me baron?â€ said Danglars; â€œyou know that I care
nothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,
do you not?â€

â€œCertainly,â€ replied Albert, â€œseeing that without my title I should be
nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the
millionaire.â€

â€œWhich seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,â€ replied
Danglars.

â€œUnfortunately,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œoneâ€™s title to a millionaire does
not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;
for example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have
just become bankrupts.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ said Danglars, becoming pale.

â€œYes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a
million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month
ago.â€

â€œAh, _mon Dieu!_â€ exclaimed Danglars, â€œthey have drawn on me for
200,000 francs!â€

â€œWell, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per
cent.â€

â€œYes, but it is too late,â€ said Danglars, â€œI have honored their bills.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œhere are 200,000 francs gone afterâ€”â€”â€

â€œHush, do not mention these things,â€ said Danglars; then, approaching
Monte Cristo, he added, â€œespecially before young M. Cavalcanti;â€ after
which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question.

Albert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse
with young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile
the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms
with waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from
his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he
took no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte
Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of
refusal.

â€œAlbert,â€ she asked, â€œdid you notice that?â€

â€œWhat, mother?â€

â€œThat the count has never been willing to partake of food under the
roof of M. de Morcerf.â€

â€œYes; but then he breakfasted with meâ€”indeed, he made his first
appearance in the world on that occasion.â€

â€œBut your house is not M. de Morcerfâ€™s,â€ murmured MercÃ©dÃ¨s; â€œand since
he has been here I have watched him.â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œWell, he has taken nothing yet.â€

â€œThe count is very temperate.â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s smiled sadly.

â€œApproach him,â€ said she, â€œand when the next waiter passes, insist upon
his taking something.â€

â€œBut why, mother?â€

â€œJust to please me, Albert,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s. Albert kissed his motherâ€™s
hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the
preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he
obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale.

â€œWell,â€ said she, â€œyou see he refuses?â€

â€œYes; but why need this annoy you?â€

â€œYou know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have
seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he
cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might
prefer something else.â€

â€œOh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does
not feel inclined this evening.â€

â€œAnd besides,â€ said the countess, â€œaccustomed as he is to burning
climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.â€

â€œI do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost
suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well
as the windows.â€

â€œIn a word,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€œit was a way of assuring me that his
abstinence was intended.â€

And she left the room.

A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the
jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the
garden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent.
Dancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joyâ€”everyone
inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in. At the same time
MercÃ©dÃ¨s reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable
expression of countenance which she sometimes wore. She went straight
to the group of which her husband formed the centre.

â€œDo not detain those gentlemen here, count,â€ she said; â€œthey would
prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate
here, since they are not playing.â€

â€œAh,â€ said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung _Partant pour
la Syrie_,â€”â€œwe will not go alone to the garden.â€

â€œThen,â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€œI will lead the way.â€

Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, â€œcount, will you oblige me
with your arm?â€

The count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his
eyes on MercÃ©dÃ¨s. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the
countess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that
one look. He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather
just touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the
steps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another
outlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with
loud exclamations of delight.



 Chapter 71. Bread and Salt

Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It
led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.

â€œIt was too warm in the room, was it not, count?â€ she asked.

â€œYes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors
and the blinds.â€ As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of
MercÃ©dÃ¨s tremble. â€œBut you,â€ he said, â€œwith that light dress, and
without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel
cold?â€

â€œDo you know where I am leading you?â€ said the countess, without
replying to the question.

â€œNo, madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo; â€œbut you see I make no resistance.â€

â€œWe are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the
grove.â€

The count looked at MercÃ©dÃ¨s as if to interrogate her, but she
continued to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They
reached the building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen
at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the
place of the sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess
left the arm of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.

â€œSee, count,â€ she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one
could almost detect the tears on her eyelidsâ€”â€œsee, our French grapes
are not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but
you will make allowance for our northern sun.â€ The count bowed, but
stepped back.

â€œDo you refuse?â€ said MercÃ©dÃ¨s, in a tremulous voice.

â€œPray excuse me, madame,â€ replied Monte Cristo, â€œbut I never eat
Muscatel grapes.â€

MercÃ©dÃ¨s let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging
against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat.
MercÃ©dÃ¨s drew near, and plucked the fruit.

â€œTake this peach, then,â€ she said. The count again refused. â€œWhat,
again?â€ she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to
stifle a sob; â€œreally, you pain me.â€

A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the
ground.

â€œCount,â€ added MercÃ©dÃ¨s with a supplicating glance, â€œthere is a
beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have
together eaten bread and salt under the same roof.â€

â€œI know it, madame,â€ replied the count; â€œbut we are in France, and not
in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom
of dividing bread and salt with one another.â€

â€œBut,â€ said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte
Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, â€œwe are
friends, are we not?â€

The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then
again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of
a man suddenly dazzled.

â€œCertainly, we are friends,â€ he replied; â€œwhy should we not be?â€

The answer was so little like the one MercÃ©dÃ¨s desired, that she turned
away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more like a groan. â€œThank
you,â€ she said. And they walked on again. They went the whole length of
the garden without uttering a word.

â€œSir,â€ suddenly exclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued
ten minutes in silence, â€œis it true that you have seen so much,
travelled so far, and suffered so deeply?â€

â€œI have suffered deeply, madame,â€ answered Monte Cristo.

â€œBut now you are happy?â€

â€œDoubtless,â€ replied the count, â€œsince no one hears me complain.â€

â€œAnd your present happiness, has it softened your heart?â€

â€œMy present happiness equals my past misery,â€ said the count.

â€œAre you not married?â€ asked the countess.

â€œI, married?â€ exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; â€œwho could have told
you so?â€

â€œNo one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the
Opera with a young and lovely woman.â€

â€œShe is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter
of a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to
love in the world.â€

â€œYou live alone, then?â€

â€œI do.â€

â€œYou have no sisterâ€”no sonâ€”no father?â€

â€œI have no one.â€

â€œHow can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?â€

â€œIt is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the
point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she
loved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my
memory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most
men who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker
than the hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have
done in my place; that is all.â€

The countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping for breath. â€œYes,â€ she
said, â€œand you have still preserved this love in your heartâ€”one can
only love onceâ€”and did you ever see her again?â€

30309m



â€œNever.â€

â€œNever?â€

â€œI never returned to the country where she lived.â€

â€œTo Malta?â€

â€œYes; Malta.â€

â€œShe is, then, now at Malta?â€

â€œI think so.â€

â€œAnd have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?â€

â€œHer,â€”yes.â€

â€œBut only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?â€

â€œI hate them? Not at all; why should I?â€ The countess placed herself
before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the
perfumed grapes.

â€œTake some,â€ she said.

â€œMadame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,â€ replied Monte Cristo, as if the
subject had not been mentioned before. The countess dashed the grapes
into the nearest thicket, with a gesture of despair.

â€œInflexible man!â€ she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if
the reproach had not been addressed to him.

Albert at this moment ran in. â€œOh, mother,â€ he exclaimed, â€œsuch a
misfortune has happened!â€

â€œWhat? What has happened?â€ asked the countess, as though awakening from
a sleep to the realities of life; â€œdid you say a misfortune? Indeed, I
should expect misfortunes.â€

â€œM. de Villefort is here.â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œHe comes to fetch his wife and daughter.â€

â€œWhy so?â€

â€œBecause Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the
news of M. de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s death, which took place on the first stage
after he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good
spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but
Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,
notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her
like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.â€

â€œAnd how was M. de Saint-MÃ©ran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?â€
said the count.

â€œHe was her grandfather on the motherâ€™s side. He was coming here to
hasten her marriage with Franz.â€

â€œAh, indeed!â€

â€œSo Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-MÃ©ran also grandfather to
Mademoiselle Danglars?â€

â€œAlbert, Albert,â€ said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof,
â€œwhat are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him
that he has spoken amiss.â€

And she took two or three steps forward. Monte Cristo watched her with
an air so thoughtful, and so full of affectionate admiration, that she
turned back and grasped his hand; at the same time she seized that of
her son, and joined them together.

â€œWe are friends; are we not?â€ she asked.

â€œOh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all
times I am your most respectful servant.â€ The countess left with an
indescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the
count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes.

â€œDo not my mother and you agree?â€ asked Albert, astonished.

â€œOn the contrary,â€ replied the count, â€œdid you not hear her declare
that we were friends?â€

They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and Madame de
Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel
departed almost at the same time.



 Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran

A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.
After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties
of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them,
the procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his
custom, with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else, but
which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires.

But this time the papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had
secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door
locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for
important business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder
over the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight
days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter
recollections.

Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him,
he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a
parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged,
in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either
in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his
mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies.

Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet
these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile
with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from
the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the
almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has
so perilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his
memory, again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his
lists, he shook his head.

â€œNo,â€ he murmured, â€œnone of my enemies would have waited so patiently
and laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might now come
and crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says:

â€˜Foul deeds will rise,

Though all the earth oâ€™erwhelm them, to menâ€™s eyes;â€™


but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story has
been told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated
it. M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himselfâ€”â€”

â€œBut why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?â€ asked
Villefort, after a momentâ€™s reflection, â€œwhat interest can this M. de
Monte Cristo or M. Zaccone,â€”son of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer of
a mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,â€”what
interest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and
useless fact like this? However, among all the incoherent details given
to me by the AbbÃ© Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that
enemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionâ€”that in no
period, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any
contact between him and me.â€

But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He
dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its
truth;â€”he cared little for that _mene, mene, tekel upharsin_, which
appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;â€”but what he was
really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them. While he
was endeavoring to calm his fears,â€”and instead of dwelling upon the
political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious
dreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in
fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,â€”the noise of a
carriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person
ascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as
servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in
their masterâ€™s grief.

He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost directly an old lady
entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm, and her bonnet in
her hand. The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead, and
her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost disappeared
beneath the eyelids swollen with grief.

â€œOh, sir,â€ she said; â€œoh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it;
oh, yes, I shall certainly die of it!â€

And then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a
paroxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to
approach nearer, were looking at Noirtierâ€™s old servant, who had heard
the noise from his masterâ€™s room, and run there also, remaining behind
the others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it
was she.

â€œWhy, what can have happened?â€ he exclaimed, â€œwhat has thus disturbed
you? Is M. de Saint-MÃ©ran with you?â€

â€œM. de Saint-MÃ©ran is dead,â€ answered the old marchioness, without
preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. Villefort
drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed:

â€œDead!â€”so suddenly?â€

â€œA week ago,â€ continued Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, â€œwe went out together in
the carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-MÃ©ran had been unwell for some
days; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him
with courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave. At six
leagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is
accustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to
me unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that
his face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more
violently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer
see, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from a
person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back
violently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M.
de Saint-MÃ©ran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I
arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.â€

Villefort stood with his mouth half open, quite stupefied.

â€œOf course you sent for a doctor?â€

â€œImmediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.â€

â€œYes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had
died.â€

â€œOh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic
stroke.â€

â€œAnd what did you do then?â€

â€œM. de Saint-MÃ©ran had always expressed a desire, in case his death
happened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought
to the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am
preceding him by a few days.â€

â€œOh! my poor mother!â€ said Villefort, â€œto have such duties to perform
at your age after such a blow!â€

â€œGod has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would
certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It is
true that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot
cry; at my age they say that we have no more tears,â€”still I think that
when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where is
Valentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see
Valentine.â€

30315m



Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a
ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her step-mother, and
that she should be fetched. â€œThis instant, sirâ€”this instant, I beseech
you!â€ said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm of Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran within his own, and conducted her to his apartment.

â€œRest yourself, mother,â€ he said.

The marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who
so forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still lived
for her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and
bursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an armchair, where
she buried her venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the
women, while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing
frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over
them for a moment in order to strike some other old person. Then, while
Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran remained on her knees, praying fervently,
Villefort sent for a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and
daughter from Madame de Morcerfâ€™s. He was so pale when he appeared at
the door of the ball-room, that Valentine ran to him, saying:

â€œOh, father, some misfortune has happened!â€

â€œYour grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,â€ said M. de Villefort.

â€œAnd grandpapa?â€ inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. It
was just in time, for Valentineâ€™s head swam, and she staggered; Madame
de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her
husband in dragging her to the carriage, saying:

â€œWhat a singular event! Who could have thought it? Ah, yes, it is
indeed strange!â€

And the wretched family departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging
over the rest of the evening. At the foot of the stairs, Valentine
found Barrois awaiting her.

â€œM. Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.

â€œTell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,â€ she replied,
feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of
the most service just then was Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran.

Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung
sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad
interview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husbandâ€™s arm,
maintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor
widow. She soon whispered to her husband:

â€œI think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for
the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.â€ Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran heard her.

â€œYes, yes,â€ she said softly to Valentine, â€œlet her leave; but do you
stay.â€

Madame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed,
for the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death,
had followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first
time to old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as
we have said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return,
his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger.

â€œAlas, sir,â€ exclaimed Barrois, â€œa great misfortune has happened.
Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran has arrived, and her husband is dead!â€

M. de Saint-MÃ©ran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of
friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects
another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently
overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of
inquiry.

Barrois asked, â€œMademoiselle Valentine?â€

Noirtier nodded his head.

â€œShe is at the ball, as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you
in full dress.â€ Noirtier again closed his left eye.

â€œDo you wish to see her?â€ Noirtier again made an affirmative sign.

â€œWell, they have gone to fetch her, no doubt, from Madame de Morcerfâ€™s;
I will await her return, and beg her to come up here. Is that what you
wish for?â€

â€œYes,â€ replied the invalid.

Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and
informed her of her grandfatherâ€™s wish. Consequently, Valentine came up
to Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, who in the midst of her
grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a
bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have
said, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier.

Valentine kissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness
that her eyes again filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be
exhausted. The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same
expression.

â€œYes, yes,â€ said Valentine, â€œyou mean that I have yet a kind
grandfather left, do you not.â€ The old man intimated that such was his
meaning. â€œAh, yes, happily I have,â€ replied Valentine. â€œWithout that,
what would become of me?â€

It was one oâ€™clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed
himself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of
rest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see
his child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made
her appear quite ill.

The next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the fever had not
abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be
suffering from violent nervous irritability.

â€œOh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?â€ exclaimed Valentine, perceiving
all these signs of agitation.

â€œNo, my child, no,â€ said Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran; â€œbut I was impatiently
waiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.â€

â€œMy father?â€ inquired Valentine, uneasily.

â€œYes, I wish to speak to him.â€

Valentine durst not oppose her grandmotherâ€™s wish, the cause of which
she did not know, and an instant afterwards Villefort entered.

â€œSir,â€ said Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, without using any circumlocution,
and as if fearing she had no time to lose, â€œyou wrote to me concerning
the marriage of this child?â€

â€œYes, madame,â€ replied Villefort, â€œit is not only projected but
arranged.â€

â€œYour intended son-in-law is named M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œYes, madame.â€

â€œIs he not the son of General dâ€™Ã‰pinay who was on our side, and who was
assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of
Elba?â€

â€œThe same.â€

â€œDoes he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a
Jacobin?â€

â€œOur civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,â€ said
Villefort; â€œM. dâ€™Ã‰pinay was quite a child when his father died, he
knows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with
pleasure, at least with indifference.â€

â€œIs it a suitable match?â€

â€œIn every respect.â€

â€œAnd the young man?â€

â€œIs regarded with universal esteem.â€

â€œYou approve of him?â€

â€œHe is one of the most well-bred young men I know.â€

During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent.

â€œWell, sir,â€ said Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, after a few minutesâ€™
reflection, â€œI must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to
live.â€

â€œYou, madame?â€ â€œYou, dear mamma?â€ exclaimed M. de Villefort and
Valentine at the same time.

â€œI know what I am saying,â€ continued the marchioness; â€œI must hurry
you, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother
to bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my
poor RenÃ©e, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.â€

â€œAh, madame,â€ said Villefort, â€œyou forget that I was obliged to give a
mother to my child.â€

â€œA stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the
purpose,â€”our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in
peace.â€

All this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was
something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of
delirium.

â€œIt shall be as you wish, madame,â€ said Villefort; â€œmore especially
since your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay
arrives in Parisâ€”â€”â€

30319m



â€œMy dear grandmother,â€ interrupted Valentine, â€œconsider decorumâ€”the
recent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?â€

â€œMy child,â€ exclaimed the old lady sharply, â€œlet us hear none of the
conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the
future. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly
I have not been less happy on that account.â€

â€œStill that idea of death, madame,â€ said Villefort.

â€œStill?â€”Always! I tell you I am going to dieâ€”do you understand? Well,
before dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make
my child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey
me;â€”in fact, I will know himâ€”I will!â€ continued the old lady, with a
fearful expression, â€œthat I may rise from the depths of my grave to
find him, if he should not fulfil his duty!â€

â€œMadame,â€ said Villefort, â€œyou must lay aside these exalted ideas,
which almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in
their graves, rise no more.â€

â€œAnd I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a
fearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over
my body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and
what will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes
shut, in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner
where there is a door leading into Madame Villefortâ€™s dressing-roomâ€”I
saw, I tell you, silently enter, a white figure.â€

Valentine screamed.

â€œIt was the fever that disturbed you, madame,â€ said Villefort.

30321m



â€œDoubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white
figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one
of my senses, I heard my glass removedâ€”the same which is there now on
the table.â€

â€œOh, dear mother, it was a dream.â€

â€œSo little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the bell;
but when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a
light.â€

â€œBut she saw no one?â€

â€œPhantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was the
soul of my husband!â€”Well, if my husbandâ€™s soul can come to me, why
should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is even
more direct, it seems to me.â€

â€œOh, madame,â€ said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, â€œdo
not yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy,
loved, and honored, and we will make you forgetâ€”â€”â€

â€œNever, never, never,â€ said the marchioness. â€œWhen does M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay
return?â€

â€œWe expect him every moment.â€

â€œIt is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be expeditious.
And then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all
our property returns to Valentine.â€

â€œAh, grandmamma,â€ murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the burning
brow, â€œdo you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we must not
send for a notary, but for a doctor!â€

â€œA doctor?â€ said she, shrugging her shoulders, â€œI am not ill; I am
thirstyâ€”that is all.â€

30323m



â€œWhat are you drinking, dear grandmamma?â€

â€œThe same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the tableâ€”give it to
me, Valentine.â€ Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it
to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same
glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre.

The marchioness drained the glass at a single draught, and then turned
on her pillow, repeating,

â€œThe notary, the notary!â€

M. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the
bedside of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require
the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot
burned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and
her pulse beat with feverish excitement. She was thinking of the
despair of Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran, instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his
enemy.

More than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she
would not have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named
Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; but Morrel was of
plebeian extraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de
Saint-MÃ©ran despised all who were not noble. Her secret had each time
been repressed when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction
that it would be useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her
father and mother, all would be lost.

Two hours passed thus; Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran was in a feverish sleep,
and the notary had arrived. Though his coming was announced in a very
low tone, Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran arose from her pillow.

â€œThe notary!â€ she exclaimed, â€œlet him come in.â€

The notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. â€œGo, Valentine,â€
said Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, â€œand leave me with this gentleman.â€

â€œBut, grandmammaâ€”â€”â€

â€œLeave meâ€”go!â€

The young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her handkerchief
to her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre, who told her
that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room. Valentine instantly ran
down. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one
of the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose
birth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter about her age, but
whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her
mother having been consumptive.

â€œOh,â€ said Valentine, â€œwe have been waiting for you with such
impatience, dear M. dâ€™Avrigny. But, first of all, how are Madeleine and
Antoinette?â€

Madeleine was the daughter of M. dâ€™Avrigny, and Antoinette his niece.
M. dâ€™Avrigny smiled sadly.

â€œAntoinette is very well,â€ he said, â€œand Madeleine tolerably so. But
you sent for me, my dear child. It is not your father or Madame de
Villefort who is ill. As for you, although we doctors cannot divest our
patients of nerves, I fancy you have no further need of me than to
recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field.â€

Valentine colored. M. dâ€™Avrigny carried the science of divination
almost to a miraculous extent, for he was one of the physicians who
always work upon the body through the mind.

30325m



â€œNo,â€ she replied, â€œit is for my poor grandmother. You know the
calamity that has happened to us, do you not?â€

â€œI know nothing.â€ said M. dâ€™Avrigny.

â€œAlas,â€ said Valentine, restraining her tears, â€œmy grandfather is
dead.â€

â€œM. de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œSuddenly?â€

â€œFrom an apoplectic stroke.â€

â€œAn apoplectic stroke?â€ repeated the doctor.

â€œYes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she never
left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M.
dâ€™Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!â€

â€œWhere is she?â€

â€œIn her room with the notary.â€

â€œAnd M. Noirtier?â€

â€œJust as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of
moving or speaking.â€

â€œAnd the same love for youâ€”eh, my dear child?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Valentine, â€œhe was very fond of me.â€

â€œWho does not love you?â€ Valentine smiled sadly. â€œWhat are your
grandmotherâ€™s symptoms?â€

â€œAn extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she
fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her
body, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium;
she fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even
heard the noise it made on touching her glass.â€

â€œIt is singular,â€ said the doctor; â€œI was not aware that Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran was subject to such hallucinations.â€

â€œIt is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,â€ said
Valentine; â€œand this morning she frightened me so that I thought her
mad; and my father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself
appeared deeply impressed.â€

â€œWe will go and see,â€ said the doctor; â€œwhat you tell me seems very
strange.â€ The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that
her grandmother was alone.

â€œGo upstairs,â€ she said to the doctor.

â€œAnd you?â€

â€œOh, I dare notâ€”she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am
myself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn
in the garden to recover myself.â€

The doctor pressed Valentineâ€™s hand, and while he visited her
grandmother, she descended the steps. We need not say which portion of
the garden was her favorite walk. After remaining for a short time in
the parterre surrounding the house, and gathering a rose to place in
her waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue which led to the
bench; then from the bench she went to the gate. As usual, Valentine
strolled for a short time among her flowers, but without gathering
them. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple
ornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the outward
semblance of woe.

30327m



She then turned towards the avenue. As she advanced she fancied she
heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped astonished, then the voice
reached her ear more distinctly, and she recognized it to be that of
Maximilian.



 Chapter 73. The Promise

It was indeed Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence
since the previous day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had
anticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran and the death of
the marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefortâ€™s in
connection with his attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were
realized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him
pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees.

Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as
it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the
spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her,
and she ran to the gate.

â€œYou here at this hour?â€ said she.

â€œYes, my poor girl,â€ replied Morrel; â€œI come to bring and to hear bad
tidings.â€

â€œThis is, indeed, a house of mourning,â€ said Valentine; â€œspeak,
Maximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.â€

â€œDear Valentine,â€ said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion,
â€œlisten, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious. When
are you to be married?â€

â€œI will tell you all,â€ said Valentine; â€œfrom you I have nothing to
conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear
grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared
herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await
the arrival of M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, and the following day the contract will be
signed.â€

A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and mournfully at her
he loved.

â€œAlas,â€ replied he, â€œit is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from
your own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in a few hours, will be
executed; it must be so, and I will not endeavor to prevent it. But,
since you say nothing remains but for M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay to arrive that the
contract may be signed, and the following day you will be his, tomorrow
you will be engaged to M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, for he came this morning to Paris.â€
Valentine uttered a cry.

â€œI was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,â€ said Morrel; â€œwe
were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of
your grief, when a carriage rolled into the courtyard. Never, till
then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot
help believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that carriage I
shuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified me as
much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at last
opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears
were vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count
exclaimed: â€˜Ah, here is the Baron Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay!â€™ I summoned all my
strength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned pale and trembled,
but certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left, without having
heard one word that had passed.â€

â€œPoor Maximilian!â€ murmured Valentine.

â€œValentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And remember
my life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?â€ Valentine
held down her head; she was overwhelmed.

â€œListen,â€ said Morrel; â€œit is not the first time you have contemplated
our present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think
it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who
like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret.
There are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in
heaven for their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend
must not lose one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow
which fortune strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our
ill-fortune? Tell me, Valentine for it is that I came to know.â€

Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of
resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never
occurred to her.

â€œWhat do you say, Maximilian?â€ asked Valentine. â€œWhat do you mean by a
struggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist my fatherâ€™s
order, and my dying grandmotherâ€™s wish? Impossible!â€

Morrel started.

â€œYou are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well
that you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need all my
strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you
say. But to grieve my fatherâ€”to disturb my grandmotherâ€™s last
momentsâ€”never!â€

â€œYou are right,â€ said Morrel, calmly.

â€œIn what a tone you speak!â€ cried Valentine.

â€œI speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.â€

â€œMademoiselle,â€ cried Valentine; â€œmademoiselle! Oh, selfish man! he
sees me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!â€

â€œYou mistakeâ€”I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose M.
Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you
will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.â€

â€œBut, _mon Dieu!_ tell me, how can I do otherwise?â€

â€œDo not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a
case; my selfishness will blind me,â€ replied Morrel, whose low voice
and clenched hands announced his growing desperation.

â€œWhat would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing to
accede?â€

â€œIt is not for me to say.â€

â€œYou are wrong; you must advise me what to do.â€

â€œDo you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?â€

â€œCertainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you
know my devotion to you.â€

â€œValentine,â€ said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, â€œgive me your
hand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused, and
during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through
my brain. Oh, if you refuse my adviceâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat do you advise?â€ said Valentine, raising her eyes to heaven and
sighing.

â€œI am free,â€ replied Maximilian, â€œand rich enough to support you. I
swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have
approached your forehead.â€

â€œYou make me tremble!â€ said the young girl.

â€œFollow me,â€ said Morrel; â€œI will take you to my sister, who is worthy
also to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England, for America,
or, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return to Paris
when our friends have reconciled your family.â€

Valentine shook her head.

â€œI feared it, Maximilian,â€ said she; â€œit is the counsel of a madman,
and I should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the
word â€˜Impossible, Morrel, impossible!â€™â€

â€œYou will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even
attempting to contend with it?â€ said Morrel sorrowfully.

â€œYes,â€”if I die!â€

â€œWell, Valentine,â€ resumed Maximilian, â€œI can only say again that you
are right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me that passion
blinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm reasoning. It is
then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to M.
Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay, not only by that theatrical formality invented to
heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract,
but your own will?â€

â€œAgain you drive me to despair, Maximilian,â€ said Valentine, â€œagain you
plunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell me, if your
sister listened to such a proposition?â€

â€œMademoiselle,â€ replied Morrel with a bitter smile, â€œI am selfishâ€”you
have already said soâ€”and as a selfish man I think not of what others
would do in my situation, but of what I intend doing myself. I think
only that I have known you not a whole year. From the day I first saw
you, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection.
One day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that day my hope
of future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain you would
be life to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has turned
against meâ€”I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost it. It is
an every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he
possesses but also what he has not.â€

Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness; Valentine looked
at him a moment with her large, scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to
let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart.

â€œBut, in a word, what are you going to do?â€ asked she.

â€œI am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you, mademoiselle,
solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm, so happy,
and so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in your
memory.â€

â€œOh!â€ murmured Valentine.

â€œAdieu, Valentine, adieu!â€ said Morrel, bowing.

â€œWhere are you going?â€ cried the young girl, extending her hand through
the opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she understood
from her own agitated feelings that her loverâ€™s calmness could not be
real; â€œwhere are you going?â€

â€œI am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family: and
to set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I am,
may follow.â€

â€œBefore you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.â€
The young man smiled sorrowfully.

â€œSpeak, speak!â€ said Valentine; â€œI entreat you.â€

â€œHas your resolution changed, Valentine?â€

â€œIt cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!â€ cried the young
girl.

â€œThen adieu, Valentine!â€

Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have
been supposed to be possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing
both her hands through the opening, she clasped and wrung them. â€œI must
know what you mean to do!â€ said she. â€œWhere are you going?â€

â€œOh, fear not,â€ said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance, â€œI do
not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate
reserved for me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke
him, and to fight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz
to do with it? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has
already forgotten he has seen me. He did not even know I existed when
it was arranged by your two families that you should be united. I have
no enmity against M. Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not
fall on him.â€

â€œOn whom, then!â€”on me?â€

â€œOn you? Valentine! Oh, Heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman one
loves is holy.â€

â€œOn yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?â€

â€œI am the only guilty person, am I not?â€ said Maximilian.

â€œMaximilian!â€ said Valentine, â€œMaximilian, come back, I entreat you!â€

He drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might
have thought him in his usual happy mood.

â€œListen, my dear, my adored Valentine,â€ said he in his melodious and
grave tone; â€œthose who, like us, have never had a thought for which we
need blush before the world, such may read each otherâ€™s hearts. I never
was romantic, and am no melancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred nor
Anthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has
entwined itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing
so,â€”I repeat it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life. The
moment you leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister is
happily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man
whom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer
needs my useless life. This is what I shall do; I will wait until the
very moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of
those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M.
Franz may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even
on the altar as you approach it,â€”nothing appears impossible to one
condemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape
from death is concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment, and
when my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write a
confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of
police, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some
wood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put
an end to my existence, as certainly as I am the son of the most honest
man who ever lived in France.â€

30333m



Valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her
arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The
young man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute.

â€œOh, for pityâ€™s sake,â€ said she, â€œyou will live, will you not?â€

â€œNo, on my honor,â€ said Maximilian; â€œbut that will not affect you. You
have done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.â€

Valentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.
â€œMaximilian,â€ said she, â€œMaximilian, my friend, my brother on earth, my
true husband in heaven, I entreat you, do as I do, live in suffering;
perhaps we may one day be united.â€

â€œAdieu, Valentine,â€ repeated Morrel.

â€œMy God,â€ said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven with a
sublime expression, â€œI have done my utmost to remain a submissive
daughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded neither
my prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,â€ cried she, wiping
away her tears, and resuming her firmness, â€œI am resolved not to die of
remorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and I will be yours.
Say when shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.â€

Morrel, who had already gone some few steps away, again returned, and
pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the
opening.

â€œValentine,â€ said he, â€œdear Valentine, you must not speak thusâ€”rather
let me die. Why should I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual?
Is it from mere humanity you bid me live? I would then rather die.â€

â€œTruly,â€ murmured Valentine, â€œwho on this earth cares for me, if he
does not? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom do my hopes
rest? On whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him, always on
him! Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will leave
the paternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I am,â€
cried Valentine, sobbing, â€œI will give up all, even my dear old
grandfather, whom I had nearly forgotten.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Maximilian, â€œyou shall not leave him. M. Noirtier has
evinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you leave,
tell him all; his consent would be your justification in Godâ€™s sight.
As soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead of
one child, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and
how he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,
Valentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is
happiness that awaits us.â€

â€œOh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost make
me believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father
will curse meâ€”he is inflexibleâ€”he will never pardon me. Now listen to
me, Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accidentâ€”in short, if
by any means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?â€

â€œYes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this
horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged
before a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.â€

â€œI promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely,
by my mother.â€

â€œWe will wait, then,â€ said Morrel.

â€œYes, we will wait,â€ replied Valentine, who revived at these words;
â€œthere are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we
are.â€

â€œI rely on you, Valentine,â€ said Morrel; â€œall you do will be well done;
only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran insist that M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay should be called tomorrow to sign
the contractâ€”â€”â€

â€œThen you have my promise, Maximilian.â€

â€œInstead of signingâ€”â€”â€

â€œI will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then,
let us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other. It is a
miracle, it is a providence that we have not been discovered. If we
were surprised, if it were known that we met thus, we should have no
further resource.â€

â€œYou are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?â€

â€œFrom the notary, M. Deschamps.â€

â€œI know him.â€

â€œAnd for myselfâ€”I will write to you, depend on me. I dread this
marriage, Maximilian, as much as you.â€

â€œThank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When once I
know the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over this
fence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in
which you will accompany me to my sisterâ€™s; there living, retired or
mingling in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power
to resist oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like
sheep, which only defend themselves by sighs.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Valentine, â€œI will now acknowledge you are right,
Maximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?â€ said the
young girl sorrowfully.

â€œMy adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my
satisfaction.â€

Valentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the
fence, that they nearly touched those of Morrel, which were pressed
against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier.

â€œAdieu, then, till we meet again,â€ said Valentine, tearing herself
away. â€œI shall hear from you?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!â€

The sound of a kiss was heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue.
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the
branches, and of her footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with
an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be
thus loved, and then also disappeared.

The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next
day without getting any message. It was only on the following day, at
about ten oâ€™clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.
Deschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small
billet, which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before
seen her writing. It was to this effect:

â€œTears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for
two hours, I was at the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and for two
hours I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the
signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oâ€™clock. I
have but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged
to you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to
nine at the gate.

â€œYour betrothed,

â€œValentine de Villefort.â€

â€œP.S.â€”My poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her fever
amounted to delirium; today her delirium is almost madness. You will be
very kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in
leaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,
that the contract is to be signed this evening.â€

Morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the
contract was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte
Cristo and heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony,
and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her
not inviting him; the death of M. de Saint-MÃ©ran and the dangerous
illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she
would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every
happiness.

The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, who
had left her bed to receive him, but had been obliged to return to it
immediately after.

It is easy to suppose that Morrelâ€™s agitation would not escape the
countâ€™s penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than
ever,â€”indeed, his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on
the point of telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made
to Valentine, and kept his secret.

The young man read Valentineâ€™s letter twenty times in the course of the
day. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it he
renewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman
who has made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve
from him for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really
to be supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it
is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently.

Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine
say, â€œHere I am, Maximilian; come and help me.â€ He had arranged
everything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field;
a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant,
without lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the
lamps, as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by
too many precautions. Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the
moment when, from the top of that wall, he should protect the descent
of his dear Valentine, pressing in his arms for the first time her of
whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand.

When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near,
he wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question
from a friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room,
and tried to read, but his eye glanced over the page without
understanding a word, and he threw away the book, and for the second
time sat down to sketch his plan, the ladders and the fence.

At length the hour drew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the
clocks to go on peacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that
they struck eight at half-past six. He then said, â€œIt is time to start;
the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oâ€™clock, but
perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.â€ Consequently, Morrel, having
left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the
clover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking
eight. The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin,
where Morrel had often waited.

The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a
deeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating
heart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet
no one to be seen.

The clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was
passed in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and
more frequently through the opening. The garden became darker still,
but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the
silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The house, which
was discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no
indication that so important an event as the signature of a
marriage-contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which
wanted a quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard
strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past
nine.

This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It was
a terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the
foliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and
drew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his
ladder, and, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step.
Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten.
â€œIt is impossible,â€ said Maximilian, â€œthat the signing of a contract
should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have
weighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the
forms; something must have happened.â€

And then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead
against the fence. Had Valentine fainted? or had she been discovered
and stopped in her flight? These were the only obstacles which appeared
possible to the young man.

The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and
that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most
impressed itself upon his mind. â€œIn that case,â€ said he, â€œI should lose
her, and by my own fault.â€ He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it
appeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on the
ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that
the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.

At last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his
temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one
leg over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He
was on Villefortâ€™s premisesâ€”had arrived there by scaling the wall. What
might be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to
draw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then
crossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed
through them, and could see the house distinctly.

30341m



Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was
not illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on
days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a
cloud, which at that moment obscured the moonâ€™s feeble light. A light
moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor.
These three windows were in Madame de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s room. Another
remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de
Villefortâ€™s bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order
to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made
her describe the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it
all.

This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentineâ€™s
absence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture
everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the
misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and
was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden,
when the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne
upon the wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially
exposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely,
remaining perfectly motionless.

He had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak
as she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he
should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he
would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of
this hitherto incomprehensible mystery.

The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had
concealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps,
followed by a gentleman in black. They descended, and advanced towards
the clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as
Doctor dâ€™Avrigny.

30339m



The young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he
found himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;
there he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.

â€œAh, my dear doctor,â€ said the procureur, â€œHeaven declares itself
against my house! What a dreadful deathâ€”what a blow! Seek not to
console me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrowâ€”the wound is
too deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!â€

The cold sweat sprang to the young manâ€™s brow, and his teeth chattered.
Who could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called
accursed?

â€œMy dear M. de Villefort,â€ replied the doctor, with a tone which
redoubled the terror of the young man, â€œI have not led you here to
console you; on the contraryâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat can you mean?â€ asked the procureur, alarmed.

â€œI mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you,
there is another, perhaps, still greater.â€

â€œCan it be possible?â€ murmured Villefort, clasping his hands. â€œWhat are
you going to tell me?â€

â€œAre we quite alone, my friend?â€

â€œYes, quite; but why all these precautions?â€

â€œBecause I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,â€ said the
doctor. â€œLet us sit down.â€

Villefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before
him, with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported
his head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its
beatings should be heard. â€œDead, dead!â€ repeated he within himself; and
he felt as if he were also dying.

â€œSpeak, doctorâ€”I am listening,â€ said Villefort; â€œstrikeâ€”I am prepared
for everything!â€

â€œMadame de Saint-MÃ©ran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she
enjoyed excellent health.â€ Morrel began again to breathe freely, which
he had not done during the last ten minutes.

â€œGrief has consumed her,â€ said Villefortâ€”â€œyes, grief, doctor! After
living forty years with the marquisâ€”â€”â€

â€œIt is not grief, my dear Villefort,â€ said the doctor; â€œgrief may kill,
although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in
ten minutes.â€ Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head,
which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with
amazement.

â€œWere you present during the last struggle?â€ asked M. dâ€™Avrigny.

â€œI was,â€ replied the procureur; â€œyou begged me not to leave.â€

â€œDid you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran has fallen a victim?â€

â€œI did. Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran had three successive attacks, at
intervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When
you arrived, Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran had already been panting for breath
some minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous
attack, and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and
her limbs and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then
I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had
thought. This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could
not. You held her handâ€”you were feeling her pulseâ€”and the second fit
came on before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than
the first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth
contracted and turned purple.â€

â€œAnd at the third she expired.â€

â€œAt the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you
confirmed my opinion.â€

â€œYes, before others,â€ replied the doctor; â€œbut now we are aloneâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat are you going to say? Oh, spare me!â€

â€œThat the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are
the same.â€

M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down
again, silent and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or
awake.

â€œListen,â€ said the doctor; â€œI know the full importance of the statement
I have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I have made
it.â€

â€œDo you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?â€ asked Villefort.

â€œAs a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity in
the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so
great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I
should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a
magistrate, but to a friend. And to that friend I say, â€˜During the
three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the
convulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, and am thoroughly
convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could
also specify the poison.â€™â€

â€œCan it be possible?â€

â€œThe symptoms are marked, do you see?â€”sleep broken by nervous spasms,
excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,
which by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.â€

Villefort seized the doctorâ€™s hand.

â€œOh, it is impossible,â€ said he, â€œI must be dreaming! It is frightful
to hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my
dear doctor, that you may be deceived.â€

â€œDoubtless I may, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œBut?â€

30345m



â€œBut I do not think so.â€

â€œHave pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me
lately that I am on the verge of madness.â€

â€œHas anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œHas anything been sent for from a chemistâ€™s that I have not examined?â€

â€œNothing.â€

â€œHad Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran any enemies?â€

â€œNot to my knowledge.â€

â€œWould her death affect anyoneâ€™s interest?â€

â€œIt could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiressâ€”Valentine alone.
Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to
punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.â€

â€œIndeed, my dear friend,â€ said M. dâ€™Avrigny, â€œI would not accuse
anyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,â€”of a mistake,â€”but
whether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience
and compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.â€

â€œOf whom?â€”how?â€”of what?â€

â€œMay not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given
Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran a dose prepared for his master?â€

â€œFor my father?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBut how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran?â€

â€œNothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain
diseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every
other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved
to try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him
brucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six
grains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the
paralyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed
to it, would be sufficient to kill another person.â€

â€œMy dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtierâ€™s
apartment and that of Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, and Barrois never entered
my mother-in-lawâ€™s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the
most conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost
reliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this
axiom, _errare humanum est_.â€

â€œIs there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with
myself?â€

â€œWhy do you ask me that?â€”what do you wish?â€

â€œSend for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult
together, and examine the body.â€

â€œAnd you will find traces of poison?â€

â€œNo, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of
the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall
say, â€˜Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence,
watch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.â€™â€

â€œWhat do you propose to me, dâ€™Avrigny?â€ said Villefort in despair; â€œso
soon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become
necessary; and an inquest in my houseâ€”impossible! Still,â€ continued the
procureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, â€œif you wish itâ€”if
you demand it, why then it shall be done. But, doctor, you see me
already so grievedâ€”how can I introduce into my house so much scandal,
after so much sorrow? My wife and my daughter would die of it! And I,
doctorâ€”you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupyâ€”one has not
been kingâ€™s attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a
tolerable number of enemies; mine are numerous. Let this affair be
talked of, it will be a triumph for them, which will make them rejoice,
and cover me with shame. Pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were
you a priest I should not dare tell you that, but you are a man, and
you know mankind. Doctor, pray recall your words; you have said
nothing, have you?â€

â€œMy dear M. de Villefort,â€ replied the doctor, â€œmy first duty is to
humanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran, if science could
have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us
bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am
willing, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject
should be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch alwaysâ€”watch
carefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have
found the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, â€˜You are a
magistrate, do as you will!â€™â€

â€œI thank you, doctor,â€ said Villefort with indescribable joy; â€œI never
had a better friend than you.â€ And, as if he feared Doctor dâ€™Avrigny
would recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.

When they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the
moon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken
for that of a ghost.

â€œI am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible
manner,â€ said he; â€œbut Valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so much
sorrow?â€

As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red
curtains and the three windows with white curtains. The light had
almost disappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had
just put out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light
on the window. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he
saw one of the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the
mantle-piece threw some of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen
for one moment on the balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a
sob.

It cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but
now disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was
weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although it
was impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he
thought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind
told him so. This double error became an irresistible reality, and by
one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his
hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the
risk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some
exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the
flower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white
lake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in
front of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the
door, which opened without offering any resistance.

Valentine had not seen him. Her eyes, raised towards heaven, were
watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure, its form that of a
shadow mounting towards heaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it
as the soul of her grandmother.

Meanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,
which, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had
regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort
even would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such
encounter. He would at once approach Valentineâ€™s father and acknowledge
all, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two
fond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad.

Happily he did not meet anyone. Now, especially, did he find the
description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to
him; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was
feeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take. He
turned back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to
hear the voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the door open and entered.
At the other end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay
the corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so
unexpectedly overheard. By its side, on her knees, and with her head
buried in the cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and
sobbing, her hands extended above her head, clasped and stiff. She had
turned from the window, which remained open, and was praying in accents
that would have affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid,
incoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost
stopped her utterance.

The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn
paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene. Morrel could not
resist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily
impressed, but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before
him, was more than he could bear in silence. He sighed, and whispered a
name, and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of
the chairâ€”a head like that of a Magdalen by Correggioâ€”was raised and
turned towards him. Valentine perceived him without betraying the least
surprise. A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to
minor emotions. Morrel held out his hand to her. Valentine, as her only
apology for not having met him, pointed to the corpse under the sheet,
and began to sob again.

Neither dared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to
break the silence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine
ventured.

â€œMy friend,â€ said she, â€œhow came you here? Alas, I would say you are
welcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.â€

â€œValentine,â€ said Morrel with a trembling voice, â€œI had waited since
half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the
wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the
fatal eventâ€”â€”â€

â€œWhat voices?â€ asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought of the
conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could
see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the
purple lips.

â€œYour servants,â€ said he, â€œwho were repeating the whole of the
sorrowful story; from them I learned it all.â€

â€œBut it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.â€

â€œForgive me,â€ replied Morrel; â€œI will go away.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Valentine, â€œyou might meet someone; stay.â€

â€œBut if anyone should come hereâ€”â€”â€

The young girl shook her head. â€œNo one will come,â€ said she; â€œdo not
fear, there is our safeguard,â€ pointing to the bed.

â€œBut what has become of M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€ replied Morrel.

30349m



â€œM. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was
dying.â€

â€œAlas,â€ said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this
death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.

â€œBut what redoubles my sorrow,â€ continued the young girl, as if this
feeling was to receive its immediate punishment, â€œis that the poor old
lady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might take place as
soon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was acting against
me.â€

â€œHark!â€ said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly heard in
the corridor and on the stairs.

â€œIt is my father, who has just left his study.â€

â€œTo accompany the doctor to the door,â€ added Morrel.

â€œHow do you know it is the doctor?â€ asked Valentine, astonished.

â€œI imagined it must be,â€ said Morrel.

Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close,
then M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs. He
stopped a moment in the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to
his own apartment or into Madame de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s; Morrel concealed
himself behind a door; Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to
deprive her of all fear. M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.

â€œNow,â€ said Valentine, â€œyou can neither go out by the front door nor by
the garden.â€

Morrel looked at her with astonishment.

â€œThere is but one way left you that is safe,â€ said she; â€œit is through
my grandfatherâ€™s room.â€ She rose. â€œCome,â€ she added.

â€œWhere?â€ asked Maximilian.

â€œTo my grandfatherâ€™s room.â€

â€œI in M. Noirtierâ€™s apartment?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œCan you mean it, Valentine?â€

â€œI have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need
his help,â€”come.â€

â€œBe careful, Valentine,â€ said Morrel, hesitating to comply with the
young girlâ€™s wishes; â€œI now see my errorâ€”I acted like a madman in
coming in here. Are you sure you are more reasonable?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Valentine; â€œand I have but one scruple,â€”that of leaving my
dear grandmotherâ€™s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.â€

â€œValentine,â€ said Morrel, â€œdeath is in itself sacred.â€

â€œYes,â€ said Valentine; â€œbesides, it will not be for long.â€

She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase
to M. Noirtierâ€™s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they
found the old servant.

â€œBarrois,â€ said Valentine, â€œshut the door, and let no one come in.â€

She passed first.

Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was
watching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was
something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which
struck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to
interrogate.

â€œDear grandfather.â€ said she hurriedly, â€œyou know poor grandmamma died
an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.â€

His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.

â€œTo you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?â€

The paralytic motioned â€œYes.â€

Valentine took Maximilianâ€™s hand.

â€œLook attentively, then, at this gentleman.â€

The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on
Morrel.

â€œIt is M. Maximilian Morrel,â€ said she; â€œthe son of that good merchant
of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.â€

â€œYes,â€ said the old man.

â€œHe brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render
glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of
the Legion of Honor.â€

The old man signified that he recollected him.

â€œWell, grandpapa,â€ said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to
Maximilian, â€œI love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to
marry another, I would destroy myself.â€

The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.

â€œYou like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?â€ asked
Valentine.

â€œYes.â€

â€œAnd you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my
father?â€

Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say, â€œperhaps I
may.â€

Maximilian understood him.

â€œMademoiselle,â€ said he, â€œyou have a sacred duty to fulfil in your
deceased grandmotherâ€™s room, will you allow me the honor of a few
minutesâ€™ conversation with M. Noirtier?â€

â€œThat is it,â€ said the old manâ€™s eye. Then he looked anxiously at
Valentine.

â€œDo you fear he will not understand?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œOh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I talk
to you.â€ Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile; although
shaded by sorrow,â€”â€œHe knows everything I know,â€ said she.

Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to
admit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and
sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier
that he was in Valentineâ€™s confidence and knew all their secrets,
Morrel took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all
on a table where there was a light.

â€œBut first,â€ said Morrel, â€œallow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how
much I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting
her.â€

Noirtier made a sign that he would listen.

It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere
useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of
the lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably
noble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with
trembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with
Valentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her
solitude and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He
told him his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when
he consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, â€œThat is
good, proceed.â€

â€œAnd now,â€ said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his
recital, â€œnow I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you
of my intentions?â€

â€œYes,â€ signified the old man.

â€œThis was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in
which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisterâ€™s house, to marry
her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefortâ€™s pardon.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Noirtier.

â€œWe must not do so?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œYou do not sanction our project?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œThere is another way,â€ said Morrel. The old manâ€™s interrogative eye
said, â€œWhich?â€

â€œI will go,â€ continued Maximilian, â€œI will seek M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinayâ€”I am
happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefortâ€™s
absenceâ€”and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to
challenge me.â€ Noirtierâ€™s look continued to interrogate.

â€œYou wish to know what I will do?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind me
to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by
renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure
my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through
interest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would
be forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no
other, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall
kill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry
Valentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.â€

Noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere
countenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,
adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to
a sound and faithful drawing.

Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which
was his manner of saying â€œNo.â€

â€œNo?â€ said Morrel; â€œyou disapprove of this second project, as you did
of the first?â€

â€œI do,â€ signified the old man.

â€œBut what then must be done?â€ asked Morrel. â€œMadame de Saint-MÃ©ranâ€™s
last request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must I let
things take their course?â€ Noirtier did not move. â€œI understand,â€ said
Morrel; â€œI am to wait.â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œBut delay may ruin our plan, sir,â€ replied the young man. â€œAlone,
Valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I am here
almost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity
to occur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I have
proposed to you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do
you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œDo you prefer I should seek M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œWhence then will come the help we needâ€”from chance?â€ resumed Morrel.

â€œNo.â€

â€œFrom you?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life
depends on your answer. Will our help come from you?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œYou are sure of it?â€

â€œYes.â€ There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer,
no one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.

â€œOh, thank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should
restore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained
to that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?â€ A smile
lit up the old manâ€™s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed
face.

â€œThen I must wait?â€ asked the young man.

â€œYes.â€

â€œBut the contract?â€ The same smile returned. â€œWill you assure me it
shall not be signed?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Noirtier.

â€œThe contract shall not be signed!â€ cried Morrel. â€œOh, pardon me, sir;
I can scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not sign it?â€

â€œNo,â€ said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance, Morrel still
hesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,
instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate
from enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of
his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks
of burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor
of treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his
pride, calls himself Jupiter. Whether Noirtier understood the young
manâ€™s indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his
docility, he looked uneasily at him.

â€œWhat do you wish, sir?â€ asked Morrel; â€œthat I should renew my promise
of remaining tranquil?â€ Noirtierâ€™s eye remained fixed and firm, as if
to imply that a promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face
to his hands.

â€œShall I swear to you, sir?â€ asked Maximilian.

â€œYes,â€ said the paralytic with the same solemnity. Morrel understood
that the old man attached great importance to an oath. He extended his
hand.

â€œI swear to you, on my honor,â€ said he, â€œto await your decision
respecting the course I am to pursue with M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

â€œThat is right,â€ said the old man.

â€œNow,â€ said Morrel, â€œdo you wish me to retire?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWithout seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?â€

â€œYes.â€

Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. â€œBut,â€ said he, â€œfirst
allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.â€ Noirtierâ€™s
expression could not be understood. The young man pressed his lips on
the same spot, on the old manâ€™s forehead, where Valentineâ€™s had been.
Then he bowed a second time and retired.

He found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given
directions. Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a
little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had
entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall,
and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his
cabriolet was still waiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly
wearied by so many emotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay,
threw himself on his bed and slept soundly.

 Chapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault

Two days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten oâ€™clock
in the morning, around the door of M. de Villefortâ€™s house, and a long
file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the
Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ© and the Rue de la PÃ©piniÃ¨re. Among them was one
of a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance.
It was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first
to arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange
coincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de
Saint-MÃ©ran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral
would follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-MÃ©ran,
one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and
King Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these,
added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a
claim on, formed a considerable body.

Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained
that the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second
hearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de
Villefortâ€™s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon.
The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PÃ¨re-Lachaise,
where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the
reception of his family. The remains of poor RenÃ©e were already
deposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and
mother were to be reunited with her.

The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display,
looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession
accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old
aristocracyâ€”the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to
their principles.

In one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and ChÃ¢teau-Renaud
were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness.

â€œI saw Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran only last year at Marseilles, when I was
coming back from Algiers,â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud; â€œshe looked like a
woman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent
sound health and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?â€

â€œFranz assured me,â€ replied Albert, â€œthat she was sixty-six years old.
But she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since
the death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not
completely recovered her reason.â€

â€œBut of what disease, then, did she die?â€ asked Debray.

â€œIt is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which
is the same thing, is it not?â€

â€œNearly.â€

â€œIt is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,â€ said Beauchamp.
â€œMadame de Saint-MÃ©ran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,
and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could
hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran.â€

â€œAt any rate,â€ said Albert, â€œwhatever disease or doctor may have killed
her, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,â€”or, still
rather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I
believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.â€

â€œAnd this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,
Noirtier.â€

â€œThat is a tenacious old grandfather,â€ said Beauchamp. â€œ_Tenacem
propositi virum_. I think he must have made an agreement with death to
outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles
the old Conventionalist of â€™93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, â€˜You
bend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth.
Take the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to
the battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo,
and a second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they
slumber sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep
entirely.â€™â€

â€œIdeas and men appeared the same to him,â€ said Albert. â€œOne thing only
puzzles me, namely, how Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay will like a grandfather who
cannot be separated from his wife. But where is Franz?â€

â€œIn the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already
as one of the family.â€

40024m



Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden
deaths, so quickly following each other, astonished everyone, but no
one suspected the terrible secret which M. dâ€™Avrigny had communicated,
in his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour
at the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with
the funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family
vault, ChÃ¢teau-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a
cabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees.

â€œYou here?â€ said ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, passing his arms through the young
captainâ€™s; â€œare you a friend of Villefortâ€™s? How is it that I have
never met you at his house?â€

â€œI am no acquaintance of M. de Villefortâ€™s,â€ answered Morrel, â€œbut I
was of Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran.â€ Albert came up to them at this moment
with Franz.

â€œThe time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.â€ said
Albert; â€œbut we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present
to you M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom
I made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an
excellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you
will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit,
or amiability.â€

Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to
accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but
his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory;
he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.

â€œMademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?â€ said Debray
to Franz.

â€œExtremely,â€ replied he; â€œshe looked so pale this morning, I scarcely
knew her.â€

These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart. This man had
seen Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and high-spirited officer
required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath. He took
the arm of ChÃ¢teau-Renaud, and turned towards the vault, where the
attendants had already placed the two coffins.

â€œThis is a magnificent habitation,â€ said Beauchamp, looking towards the
mausoleum; â€œa summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my
dear dâ€™Ã‰pinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. I,
as a philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down
there under the trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body.
In dying, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron:
â€˜_Eo rus_, and all will be over.â€™ But come, Franz, take courage, your
wife is an heiress.â€

â€œIndeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh at
everything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. But
when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the
pleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your
affectionate heart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the
Chamber.â€

â€œBut tell me,â€ said Beauchamp, â€œwhat is life? Is it not a halt in
Deathâ€™s anteroom?â€

40026m



â€œI am prejudiced against Beauchamp,â€ said Albert, drawing Franz away,
and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with
Debray.

The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet
high; an interior partition separated the two families, and each
apartment had its entrance door. Here were not, as in other tombs,
ignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and
labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the
bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall from the
vault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this
wall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-MÃ©ran coffins. There grief
might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling
loungers who came from a picnic party to visit PÃ¨re-Lachaise, or by
lovers who make it their rendezvous.

The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their
reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-MÃ©ran family.
Villefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.

As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and
there was no address given, the party all separated; ChÃ¢teau-Renaud,
Albert, and Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other.
Franz remained with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel
made an excuse to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the
same mourning-coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then
returned to Paris, and although in the same carriage with
ChÃ¢teau-Renaud and Albert, he did not hear one word of their
conversation.

As Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort, â€œWhen shall I see
you again?â€ said the latter.

â€œAt what time you please, sir,â€ replied Franz.

â€œAs soon as possible.â€

â€œI am at your command, sir; shall we return together?â€

â€œIf not unpleasant to you.â€

â€œOn the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.â€

Thus, the future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage,
and Morrel, seeing them pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz
returned to the Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©. The procureur, without going to
see either his wife or his daughter, went at once to his study, and,
offering the young man a chair:

â€œM. dâ€™Ã‰pinay,â€ said he, â€œallow me to remind you at this moment,â€”which
is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear, for
obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which
should be made at their tomb,â€”allow me then to remind you of the wish
expressed by Madame de Saint-MÃ©ran on her death-bed, that Valentineâ€™s
wedding might not be deferred. You know the affairs of the deceased are
in perfect order, and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire
property of the Saint-MÃ©ran family; the notary showed me the documents
yesterday, which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately.
You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau, Faubourg
Saint-HonorÃ©, and you have my authority to inspect those deeds.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, â€œit is not, perhaps, the moment for
Mademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think of a husband;
indeed, I fearâ€”â€”â€

40028m



â€œValentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her
grandmotherâ€™s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that
quarter, I assure you.â€

â€œIn that case,â€ replied Franz, â€œas I shall raise none, you may make
arrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel
pleasure and happiness in adhering to it.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Villefort, â€œnothing further is required. The contract was
to have been signed three days since; we shall find it all ready, and
can sign it today.â€

â€œBut the mourning?â€ said Franz, hesitating.

â€œDonâ€™t be uneasy on that score,â€ replied Villefort; â€œno ceremony will
be neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during
the prescribed three months to her estate of Saint-MÃ©ran; I say hers,
for she inherits it today. There, after a few days, if you like, the
civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony. Madame de
Saint-MÃ©ran wished her daughter should be married there. When that is
over, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife passes the time of
her mourning with her mother-in-law.â€

â€œAs you please, sir,â€ said Franz.

â€œThen,â€ replied M. de Villefort, â€œhave the kindness to wait half an
hour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will send for
M. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate,
and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her
estate, where we will rejoin them in a week.â€

â€œSir,â€ said Franz, â€œI have one request to make.â€

â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œI wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de ChÃ¢teau-Renaud to be present at
this signature; you know they are my witnesses.â€

â€œHalf an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them
yourself, or shall you send?â€

â€œI prefer going, sir.â€

â€œI shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will
be ready.â€

Franz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de
Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in
half an hour, as he expected the notary and M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay and his
witnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the house;
Madame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was
thunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone down to
her grandfatherâ€™s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who
took her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom,
Valentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A
moment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her
little Edward. It was evident that she had shared the grief of the
family, for she was pale and looked fatigued. She sat down, took Edward
on her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her
affections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom.

Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard. One was the
notaryâ€™s; the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the
whole party was assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the
blue veins from her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz
was deeply affected. ChÃ¢teau-Renaud and Albert looked at each other
with amazement; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared
more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin. Madame de
Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and
as she constantly bent over her child, it was difficult to read the
expression of her face. M. de Villefort was, as usual, unmoved.

The notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged
the papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his
spectacles, turned towards Franz:

â€œAre you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€ asked he, although he
knew it perfectly.

â€œYes, sir,â€ replied Franz. The notary bowed.

â€œI have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de Villefort,
that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed
the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he
disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. Let me
hasten to add,â€ continued he, â€œthat the testator, having only the right
to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the
will will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.â€

â€œYes.â€ said Villefort; â€œbut I warn M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay, that during my
life-time my fatherâ€™s will shall never be questioned, my position
forbidding any doubt to be entertained.â€

40032m



â€œSir,â€ said Franz, â€œI regret much that such a question has been raised
in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never inquired the
amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds mine.
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de
Villefort; all I seek is happiness.â€

Valentine imperceptibly thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down
her cheeks.

â€œBesides, sir,â€ said Villefort, addressing himself to his future
son-in-law, â€œexcepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this
unexpected will need not personally wound you; M. Noirtierâ€™s weakness
of mind sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle
Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will
marry, a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow.
Old age is selfish, sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a
faithful companion to M. Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes
the Baroness dâ€™Ã‰pinay. My fatherâ€™s melancholy state prevents our
speaking to him on any subjects, which the weakness of his mind would
incapacitate him from understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that
at the present time, although, he knows that his granddaughter is going
to be married, M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended
grandson.â€ M. de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door
opened, and Barrois appeared.

â€œGentlemen,â€ said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking
to his masters under such solemn circumstances,â€”â€œgentlemen, M. Noirtier
de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron
dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€ He, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in
the person, gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect.

Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees,
Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and ChÃ¢teau-Renaud
exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The
notary looked at Villefort.

â€œIt is impossible,â€ said the procureur. â€œM. dâ€™Ã‰pinay cannot leave the
drawing-room at present.â€

â€œIt is at this moment,â€ replied Barrois with the same firmness, â€œthat
M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M.
Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay.â€

â€œGrandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,â€ said Edward, with his
habitual quickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de
Villefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was
the situation.

â€œTell M. Nortier,â€ resumed Villefort, â€œthat what he demands is
impossible.â€

â€œThen, M. Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen,â€ replied Barrois,
â€œthat he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room.â€

Astonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was perceptible
on Madame de Villefortâ€™s countenance. Valentine instinctively raised
her eyes, as if to thank heaven.

â€œPray go, Valentine,â€ said; M. de Villefort, â€œand see what this new
fancy of your grandfatherâ€™s is.â€ Valentine rose quickly, and was
hastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort altered his
intention.

â€œStop,â€ said he; â€œI will go with you.â€

â€œExcuse me, sir,â€ said Franz, â€œsince M. Noirtier sent for me, I am
ready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay my
respects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.â€

â€œPray, sir,â€ said Villefort with marked uneasiness, â€œdo not disturb
yourself.â€

40032m



â€œForgive me, sir,â€ said Franz in a resolute tone. â€œI would not lose
this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him
to encourage feelings of dislike to me, which I am determined to
conquer, whatever they may be, by my devotion.â€

And without listening to Villefort he arose, and followed Valentine,
who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who
finds a rock to cling to. M. de Villefort followed them. ChÃ¢teau-Renaud
and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder.



 Chapter 75. A Signed Statement

Noirtier was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed
in his armchair. When the three persons he expected had entered, he
looked at the door, which his valet immediately closed.

â€œListen,â€ whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not conceal her
joy; â€œif M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay
your marriage, I forbid you to understand him.â€

Valentine blushed, but did not answer. Villefort, approached Noirtier.

â€œHere is M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay,â€ said he; â€œyou requested to see him. We
have all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince you
how ill-formed are your objections to Valentineâ€™s marriage.â€

Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefortâ€™s blood run cold.
He motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit
of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a
key. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the
windows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding
that was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an
old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed
to contain nothing but useless documents.

â€œShall I open the secretaire?â€ asked Valentine.

â€œYes,â€ said the old man.

â€œAnd the drawers?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œThose at the side?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œThe middle one?â€

â€œYes.â€

Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. â€œIs that what you
wish for?â€ asked she.

â€œNo.â€

She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was
empty. â€œBut there are no more,â€ said she. Noirtierâ€™s eye was fixed on
the dictionary.

â€œYes, I understand, grandfather,â€ said the young girl.

40036m



She pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man
stopped her. She opened, and found the word â€œsecret.â€

â€œAh! is there a secret spring?â€ said Valentine.

â€œYes,â€ said Noirtier.

â€œAnd who knows it?â€ Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had
gone out.

â€œBarrois?â€ said she.

â€œYes.â€

â€œShall I call him?â€

â€œYes.â€

Valentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefortâ€™s impatience
during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and
Franz was stupefied. The old servant came.

â€œBarrois,â€ said Valentine, â€œmy grandfather has told me to open that
drawer in the secretaire, but there is a secret spring in it, which you
knowâ€”will you open it?â€

Barrois looked at the old man. â€œObey,â€ said Noirtierâ€™s intelligent eye.
Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a
bundle of papers tied with a black string.

â€œIs that what you wish for?â€ said Barrois.

â€œYes.â€

â€œShall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œTo Mademoiselle Valentine?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œTo M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay?â€

â€œYes.â€

Franz, astonished, advanced a step. â€œTo me, sir?â€ said he.

â€œYes.â€

Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read:

â€œâ€˜To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath
the packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing
an important document.â€™

â€œWell, sir,â€ asked Franz, â€œwhat do you wish me to do with this paper?â€

â€œTo preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,â€ said the procureur.

â€œNo,â€ replied Noirtier eagerly.

â€œDo you wish him to read it?â€ said Valentine.

â€œYes,â€ replied the old man.

â€œYou understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,â€
said Valentine.

â€œThen let us sit down,â€ said Villefort impatiently, â€œfor it will take
some time.â€

â€œSit down,â€ said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine
remained standing by her fatherâ€™s side, and Franz before him, holding
the mysterious paper in his hand. â€œRead,â€ said the old man. Franz
untied it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:

40038m



â€œâ€˜_Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the
Rue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815_.â€™â€

Franz stopped. â€œFebruary 5th, 1815!â€ said he; â€œit is the day my father
was murdered.â€ Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old
man alone seemed to say clearly, â€œGo on.â€

â€œBut it was on leaving this club,â€ said he, â€œmy father disappeared.â€

Noirtierâ€™s eye continued to say, â€œRead.â€ He resumed:â€”

â€œâ€˜The undersigned Louis-Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of
artillery, Ã‰tienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal,
keeper of woods and forests, declare, that on the 4th of February, a
letter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness
and the confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel,
who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be
devoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the
title of baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his
estate of Ã‰pinay.

400340m



â€œâ€˜A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging
him to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note indicated
neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to
be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that
someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oâ€™clock. The
meetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine oâ€™clock
the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the
president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction
was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and
that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not
endeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the
condition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road
they took. The generalâ€™s carriage was ready, but the president told him
it was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold
the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. â€œWhat
must be done then?â€ asked the general.â€”â€œI have my carriage here,â€ said
the president.

â€œâ€˜â€œHave you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can
intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?â€

â€œâ€˜â€œOur coachman is a member of the club,â€ said the president; â€œwe shall
be driven by a State-Councillor.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œThen we run another risk,â€ said the general, laughing, â€œthat of
being upset.â€ We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in
the least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly.
When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the
general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he
made no opposition. On the road the president thought he saw the
general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of
his oath. â€œSure enough,â€ said the general. The carriage stopped at an
alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted,
leaning on the arm of the president, of whose dignity he was not aware,
considering him simply as a member of the club; they went through the
alley, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered the assembly-room.

â€œâ€˜The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the
sort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in
attendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to
remove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so
many well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then
been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he
contented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of
Elba ought to have informed themâ€”â€”â€™â€

Franz interrupted himself by saying, â€œMy father was a royalist; they
need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.â€

â€œAnd hence,â€ said Villefort, â€œarose my affection for your father, my
dear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.â€

â€œRead again,â€ said the old man.

Franz continued:

â€œâ€˜The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M.
de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with
him. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island
of Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be
likely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of
the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further
details, on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder
Morrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the
emperor. During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to
have relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent
and repugnance. When the reading was finished, he remained silent, with
knitted brows.

â€œâ€˜â€œWell,â€ asked the president, â€œwhat do you say to this letter,
general?â€

â€œâ€˜â€œI say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII. to
break my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.â€ This answer was too clear to
permit of any mistake as to his sentiments. â€œGeneral,â€ said the
president, â€œwe acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor, but
his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his
kingdom, by violence and treason.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œExcuse me, gentlemen,â€ said the general; â€œyou may not acknowledge
Louis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal,
and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his
happy return to France.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œSir,â€ said the president, rising with gravity, â€œbe careful what you
say; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you
in the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been
made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which
does you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach
you to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to
help us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel
you to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œYou would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not
informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your
accomplice. You see I am more candid than you.â€â€™â€

â€œAh, my father!â€ said Franz, interrupting himself. â€œI understand now
why they murdered him.â€ Valentine could not help casting one glance
towards the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to
behold. Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the
expression of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding
attitude. Franz returned to the manuscript, and continued:

â€œâ€˜â€œSir,â€ said the president, â€œyou have been invited to join this
assemblyâ€”you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come
blindfoldedâ€”you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request
you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII., or
we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police.
It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you
in the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin
those who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if you
declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his
majesty the emperor.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œI am a royalist,â€ replied the general; â€œI have taken the oath of
allegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.â€ These words were
followed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the
members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of
his rashness.

â€œâ€˜The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,â€”â€œSir,
you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the
consequences of our present situation, and your candor has already
dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.â€ The
general, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,â€”â€œIf you talk of
honor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by
violence.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œAnd you, sir,â€ continued the president, with a calmness still more
terrible than the generalâ€™s anger, â€œI advise you not to touch your
sword.â€ The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however
he did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,â€”â€œI will not
swear.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œThen you must die,â€ replied the president calmly. M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay became
very pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the
club were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks.
â€œGeneral,â€ said the president, â€œdo not alarm yourself; you are among
men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting
to the last extremity, but as you have said, you are among
conspirators, you are in possession of our secret, and you must restore
it to us.â€ A significant silence followed these words, and as the
general did not reply,â€”â€œClose the doors,â€ said the president to the
door-keeper.

40042m



â€œâ€˜The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the general
advanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,â€”â€œI have
a son,â€ said he, â€œand I ought to think of him, finding myself among
assassins.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œGeneral,â€ said the chief of the assembly, â€œone man may insult
fiftyâ€”it is the privilege of weakness. But he does wrong to use his
privilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.â€ The general,
again daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then
advancing to the presidentâ€™s desk,â€”â€œWhat is the form, said he.

â€œâ€˜â€œIt is this:â€”â€˜I swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have
seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and ten
oâ€™clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever
violate this oath.â€™â€ The general appeared to be affected by a nervous
tremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then,
overcoming his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath,
but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the
members, who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which
he did.

â€œâ€˜â€œNow am I at liberty to retire?â€ said the general. The president
rose, appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the
carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three
members was the coachman who had driven them there. The other members
silently dispersed. â€œWhere do you wish to be taken?â€ asked the
president.â€”â€œAnywhere out of your presence,â€ replied M. dâ€™Ã‰pinay.
â€œBeware, sir,â€ replied the president, â€œyou are no longer in the
assembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them
unless you wish to be held responsible.â€ But instead of listening, M.
dâ€™Ã‰pinay went on,â€”â€œYou are still as brave in your carriage as in your
assembly because you are still four against one.â€ The president stopped
the coach. They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps
lead down to the river. â€œWhy do you stop here?â€ asked dâ€™Ã‰pinay.

â€œâ€˜â€œBecause, sir,â€ said the president, â€œyou have insulted a man, and
that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable
reparation.â€

â€œâ€˜â€œAnother method of assassination?â€ said the general, shrugging his
shoulders.

â€œâ€˜â€œMake no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as one of the
men of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their weakness for
a shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword
by your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these
gentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage.â€ The
general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. â€œAt last,â€ said he, â€œI
shall know with whom I have to do.â€ They opened the door and the four
men alighted.â€™â€

Franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his
brow; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in
trembling pallor these details of his fatherâ€™s death, which had
hitherto been a mystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer.
Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of
contempt and pride.

Franz continued:

â€œâ€˜It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days the mercury
had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered
with ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the
side of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two witnesses
followed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the river
was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked
black and deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge
near, and by its light they examined the weapons. The presidentâ€™s
sword, which was simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane,
was five inches shorter than the generalâ€™s, and had no guard. The
general proposed to cast lots for the swords, but the president said it
was he who had given the provocation, and when he had given it he had
supposed each would use his own arms. The witnesses endeavored to
insist, but the president bade them be silent. The lantern was placed
on the ground, the two adversaries took their stations, and the duel
began. The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning;
as for the men, they were scarcely perceptible, the darkness was so
great.

40044m



â€œâ€˜General dâ€™Ã‰pinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army,
but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and
fell. The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he
had not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise. The
circumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he rushed on
his adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken.
He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on
finding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge.
At the third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and
the witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to
raise him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was
moistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived.
â€œAh,â€ said he, â€œthey have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.â€
The president, without answering, approached the witness who held the
lantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received
in his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat,
displayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even
uttered a sigh. General dâ€™Ã‰pinay died five minutes after.â€™â€

Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly
audible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to
dispel a cloud; but after a momentâ€™s silence, he continued:

â€œâ€˜The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his
cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had scarcely
arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterâ€”it was the
generalâ€™s body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the river
after ascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a loyal
duel, and not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of
this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts,
lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this
terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of
infringement of the laws of honor.

â€œâ€˜Signed, Beaurepaire, Duchampy, and Lecharpal.â€™â€

When Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son;
when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when
Villefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to
lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,â€”

â€œSir,â€ said dâ€™Ã‰pinay to Noirtier, â€œsince you are well acquainted with
all these details, which are attested by honorable signatures,â€”since
you appear to take some interest in me, although you have only
manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final
satisfactionâ€”tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may
at least know who killed my father.â€

Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door; Valentine, who
understood sooner than anyone her grandfatherâ€™s answer, and who had
often seen two scars upon his right arm, drew back a few steps.

â€œMademoiselle,â€ said Franz, turning towards Valentine, â€œunite your
efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan
at two years of age.â€ Valentine remained dumb and motionless.

â€œHold, sir,â€ said Villefort, â€œdo not prolong this dreadful scene. The
names have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know
who this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper
names are not in the dictionary.â€

â€œOh, misery,â€ cried Franz: â€œthe only hope which sustained me and
enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name
of him who killed my father! Sir, sir,â€ cried he, turning to Noirtier,
â€œdo what you canâ€”make me understand in some way!â€

â€œYes,â€ replied Noirtier.

â€œOh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!â€ cried Franz, â€œyour grandfather says
he can indicate the person. Help me,â€”lend me your assistance!â€

Noirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous
trembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until
he came to M. At that letter the old man signified â€œYes.â€

â€œM,â€ repeated Franz. The young manâ€™s finger, glided over the words, but
at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her
head between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.

40046m



â€œYes!â€

â€œYou!â€ cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; â€œyou, M. Noirtierâ€”you
killed my father?â€

â€œYes!â€ replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man. Franz
fell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for
the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in
the heart of this terrible old man.




 Chapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger

Meanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in
the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table
of the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous
courtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his
journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had
maintained his assumed character of father.

M. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that
he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and
the Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that
Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and
treats them, not as they really are, but as they wish to be considered.
Besides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak its
language tolerably, to make a good appearance, to be a good gamester,
and to pay in cash. They are certainly less particular with a foreigner
than with a Frenchman. Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a
very fair position. He was called count, he was said to possess 50,000
livres per annum; and his fatherâ€™s immense riches, buried in the
quarries of Saravezza, were a constant theme. A learned man, before
whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact, declared he had
seen the quarries in question, which gave great weight to assertions
hitherto somewhat doubtful, but which now assumed the garb of reality.

Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before
our readers, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a
visit. M. Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the
baroness, and he accepted the invitation. It was never without a
nervous shudder, since the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which
followed it, that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristoâ€™s name announced.
If he did not come, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on
the contrary, he appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes,
his amiability, his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon
dispelled every impression of fear. It appeared impossible to the
baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should
entertain evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt minds
only suspect evil when it would answer some interested endâ€”useless
injury is repugnant to every mind.

40048m



When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir, to which we have already once
introduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some
drawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them
with M. Cavalcanti, his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it
was with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had
been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name. The latter
took in the whole scene at a glance.

The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, EugÃ©nie sat near her,
and Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of
Goetheâ€™s heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked
stockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his
light hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of
Monte Cristoâ€™s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist
putting on his little finger. This movement was accompanied by killing
glances at Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same
direction.

Mademoiselle Danglars was still the sameâ€”cold, beautiful, and
satirical. Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her;
they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some
philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho. EugÃ©nie
bowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when
the conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very
soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with
occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle
Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the
company of Mademoiselle Louise dâ€™Armilly, her singing teacher.

It was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and
apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count
noticed M. Andrea Cavalcantiâ€™s solicitude, his manner of listening to
the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his
admiration.

The banker soon returned. His first look was certainly directed towards
Monte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea. As for his wife, he bowed
to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way that bachelors
will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is published on
conjugal life.

â€œHave not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?â€ said
Danglars to Andrea.

â€œAlas, no, sir,â€ replied Andrea with a sigh, still more remarkable than
the former ones. Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and
opened it.

40050m



The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano,
accompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had
accustomed themselves, and performed admirably. Mademoiselle dâ€™Armilly,
whom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with EugÃ©nie
one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so fond. She was
somewhat beautiful, and exquisitely formedâ€”a little fairy-like figure,
with large curls falling on her neck, which was rather too long, as
Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins, and her eyes dull from fatigue.
She was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the _Cremona
Violin_, she would die one day while singing.

Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it
was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dâ€™Armilly, of whom he
had heard much.

â€œWell,â€ said the banker to his daughter, â€œare we then all to be
excluded?â€

He then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or
manÅ“uvre the door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the
place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see
anything; but as the banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars
appeared to take no notice of it.

The count soon heard Andreaâ€™s voice, singing a Corsican song,
accompanied by the piano. While the count smiled at hearing this song,
which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto,
Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husbandâ€™s strength
of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand
francs by a failure at Milan. The praise was well deserved, for had not
the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which
he knew everything, the baronâ€™s countenance would not have led him to
suspect it.

â€œHem,â€ thought Monte Cristo, â€œhe begins to conceal his losses; a month
since he boasted of them.â€

Then aloud,â€”â€œOh, madame, M. Danglars is so skilful, he will soon regain
at the Bourse what he loses elsewhere.â€

â€œI see that you participate in a prevalent error,â€ said Madame
Danglars.

â€œWhat is it?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œThat M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does.â€

â€œTruly, madame, I recollect M. Debray told meâ€”â€”apropos, what has become
of him? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days.â€

â€œNor I,â€ said Madame Danglars; â€œbut you began a sentence, sir, and did
not finish.â€

â€œWhich?â€

â€œM. Debray had told youâ€”â€”â€

â€œAh, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of
speculation.â€

â€œI was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now.â€

â€œThen you are wrong, madame. Fortune is precarious; and if I were a
woman and fate had made me a bankerâ€™s wife, whatever might be my
confidence in my husbandâ€™s good fortune, still in speculation you know
there is great risk. Well, I would secure for myself a fortune
independent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in
hands unknown to him.â€ Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her
efforts.

â€œStay,â€ said Monte Cristo, as though he had not observed her confusion,
â€œI have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan
bonds.â€

â€œI have noneâ€”nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have talked
long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you
heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?â€

â€œWhat has happened?â€ said the count, simulating total ignorance.

â€œYou know the Marquis of Saint-MÃ©ran died a few days after he had set
out on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her
arrival?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œI have heard that; but, as Claudius said to
Hamlet, â€˜it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them, and
they mourned their loss; they will die before their children, who will,
in their turn, grieve for them.â€™â€

â€œBut that is not all.â€

â€œNot all!â€

â€œNo; they were going to marry their daughterâ€”â€”â€

â€œTo M. Franz dâ€™Ã‰pinay. Is it broken off?â€

â€œYesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor.â€

â€œIndeed? And is the reason known?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œHow extraordinary! And how does M. de Villefort bear it?â€

â€œAs usual. Like a philosopher.â€

Danglars returned at this moment alone.

â€œWell,â€ said the baroness, â€œdo you leave M. Cavalcanti with your
daughter?â€

â€œAnd Mademoiselle dâ€™Armilly,â€ said the banker; â€œdo you consider her no
one?â€ Then, turning to Monte Cristo, he said, â€œPrince Cavalcanti is a
charming young man, is he not? But is he really a prince?â€

â€œI will not answer for it,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œHis father was
introduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I do not
think he has much claim to that title.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said the banker. â€œIf he is a prince, he is wrong not to maintain
his rank; I do not like anyone to deny his origin.â€

â€œOh, you are a thorough democrat,â€ said Monte Cristo, smiling.

â€œBut do you see to what you are exposing yourself?â€ said the baroness.
â€œIf, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M. Cavalcanti in that
room, where he, the betrothed of EugÃ©nie, has never been admitted.â€

â€œYou may well say, perchance,â€ replied the banker; â€œfor he comes so
seldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.â€

â€œBut should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he
might be displeased.â€

â€œHe? You are mistaken. M. Albert would not do us the honor to be
jealous; he does not like EugÃ©nie sufficiently. Besides, I care not for
his displeasure.â€

â€œStill, situated as we areâ€”â€”â€

â€œYes, do you know how we are situated? At his motherâ€™s ball he danced
once with EugÃ©nie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice
of it.â€

The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. The baroness rose
hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her.

â€œLet her alone,â€ said he.

She looked at him in amazement. Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious
of what passed. Albert entered, looking very handsome and in high
spirits. He bowed politely to the baroness, familiarly to Danglars, and
affectionately to Monte Cristo. Then turning to the baroness: â€œMay I
ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?â€ said he.

â€œShe is quite well,â€ replied Danglars quickly; â€œshe is at the piano
with M. Cavalcanti.â€

Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he might feel perhaps
annoyed, but he knew Monte Cristoâ€™s eye was on him. â€œM. Cavalcanti has
a fine tenor voice,â€ said he, â€œand Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie a splendid
soprano, and then she plays the piano like Thalberg. The concert must
be a delightful one.â€

â€œThey suit each other remarkably well,â€ said Danglars. Albert appeared
not to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that Madame
Danglars blushed.

â€œI, too,â€ said the young man, â€œam a musicianâ€”at least, my masters used
to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any
other, and a soprano less than any.â€

Danglars smiled, and seemed to say, â€œIt is of no consequence.â€ Then,
hoping doubtless to effect his purpose, he said,â€”â€œThe prince and my
daughter were universally admired yesterday. You were not of the party,
M. de Morcerf?â€

â€œWhat prince?â€ asked Albert.

â€œPrince Cavalcanti,â€ said Danglars, who persisted in giving the young
man that title.

â€œPardon me,â€ said Albert, â€œI was not aware that he was a prince. And
Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie yesterday? It must
have been charming, indeed. I regret not having heard them. But I was
unable to accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my
mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChÃ¢teau-Renaud.â€

This was followed by rather an awkward silence.

â€œMay I also be allowed,â€ said Morcerf, â€œto pay my respects to
Mademoiselle Danglars?â€

â€œWait a moment,â€ said the banker, stopping the young man; â€œdo you hear
that delightful cavatina? Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta, ta; it is
charming, let them finishâ€”one moment. Bravo, bravi, brava!â€ The banker
was enthusiastic in his applause.

40054m



â€œIndeed,â€ said Albert, â€œit is exquisite; it is impossible to understand
the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does. You said
prince, did you not? But he can easily become one, if he is not
already; it is no uncommon thing in Italy. But to return to the
charming musiciansâ€”you should give us a treat, Danglars, without
telling them there is a stranger. Ask them to sing one more song; it is
so delightful to hear music in the distance, when the musicians are
unrestrained by observation.â€

Danglars was quite annoyed by the young manâ€™s indifference. He took
Monte Cristo aside.

â€œWhat do you think of our lover?â€ said he.

â€œHe appears cool. But, then your word is given.â€

â€œYes, doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves
her, but not to one who does not. See him there, cold as marble and
proud like his father. If he were rich, if he had Cavalcantiâ€™s fortune,
that might be pardoned. _Ma foi_, I havenâ€™t consulted my daughter; but
if she has good tasteâ€”â€”â€

â€œOh,â€ said Monte Cristo, â€œmy fondness may blind me, but I assure you I
consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter
happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction,
and his fatherâ€™s position is good.â€

â€œHem,â€ said Danglars.

â€œWhy do you doubt?â€

â€œThe pastâ€”that obscurity on the past.â€

â€œBut that does not affect the son.â€

â€œVery true.â€

â€œNow, I beg of you, donâ€™t go off your head. Itâ€™s a month now that you
have been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws
some responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young
Cavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all.â€

â€œBut I do.â€

â€œHave you made inquiry?â€

â€œIs there any need of that! Does not his appearance speak for him? And
he is very rich.â€

â€œI am not so sure of that.â€

â€œAnd yet you said he had money.â€

â€œFifty thousand livresâ€”a mere trifle.â€

â€œHe is well educated.â€

â€œHem,â€ said Monte Cristo in his turn.

â€œHe is a musician.â€

â€œSo are all Italians.â€

â€œCome, count, you do not do that young man justice.â€

â€œWell, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the
Morcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.â€ Danglars burst
out laughing.

â€œWhat a Puritan you are!â€ said he; â€œthat happens every day.â€

â€œBut you cannot break it off in this way; the Morcerfs are depending on
this union.â€

â€œIndeed.â€

â€œPositively.â€

â€œThen let them explain themselves; you should give the father a hint,
you are so intimate with the family.â€

â€œI?â€”where the devil did you find out that?â€

â€œAt their ball; it was apparent enough. Why, did not the countess, the
proud MercÃ©dÃ¨s, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her
lips to her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the
garden, into the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?â€

â€œAh, baron, baron,â€ said Albert, â€œyou are not listeningâ€”what barbarism
in a megalomaniac like you!â€

â€œOh, donâ€™t worry about me, Sir Mocker,â€ said Danglars; then turning to
Monte Cristo he said:

â€œBut will you undertake to speak to the father?â€

â€œWillingly, if you wish it.â€

â€œBut let it be done explicitly and positively. If he demands my
daughter let him fix the dayâ€”declare his conditions; in short, let us
either understand each other, or quarrel. You understandâ€”no more
delay.â€

â€œYes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject.â€

â€œI do not say that I await with pleasure his decision, but I do await
it. A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise.â€ And Danglars
sighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before.

â€œBravi! bravo! brava!â€ cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the
selection came to an end. Danglars began to look suspiciously at
Morcerf, when someone came and whispered a few words to him.

â€œI shall soon return,â€ said the banker to Monte Cristo; â€œwait for me. I
shall, perhaps, have something to say to you.â€ And he went out.

The baroness took advantage of her husbandâ€™s absence to push open the
door of her daughterâ€™s study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting before the
piano with Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie, started up like a jack-in-the-box.
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who did not appear
in the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied
with the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out in
praise of Mademoiselle Danglarsâ€™ voice, and on his regret, after what
he had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous
evening.

Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.

â€œCome,â€ said Madame Danglars, â€œleave music and compliments, and let us
go and take tea.â€

â€œCome, Louise,â€ said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend.

They passed into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as
they were beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in
their cups, the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly
agitated. Monte Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked
the banker for an explanation.

â€œI have just received my courier from Greece,â€ said Danglars.

â€œAh, yes,â€ said the count; â€œthat was the reason of your running away
from us.â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHow is King Otho getting on?â€ asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.

Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering,
and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which
passed over his features, but which was gone in a moment.

â€œWe shall go together, shall we not?â€ said Albert to the count.

â€œIf you like,â€ replied the latter.

Albert could not understand the bankerâ€™s look, and turning to Monte
Cristo, who understood it perfectly,â€”â€œDid you see,â€ said he, â€œhow he
looked at me?â€

â€œYes,â€ said the count; â€œbut did you think there was anything particular
in his look?â€

â€œIndeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?â€

â€œHow can I tell you?â€

â€œBecause I imagine you have correspondents in that country.â€

Monte Cristo smiled significantly.

â€œStop,â€ said Albert, â€œhere he comes. I shall compliment Mademoiselle
Danglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.â€

â€œIf you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least,â€ said
Monte Cristo.

â€œNo, everyone would do that.â€

â€œMy dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.â€

Albert advanced towards EugÃ©nie, smiling.

Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte Cristoâ€™s ear, â€œYour advice was
excellent,â€ said he; â€œthere is a whole history connected with the names
Fernand and Yanina.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ said Monte Cristo.

â€œYes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure
his presence.â€

â€œHe is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?â€

â€œImmediately.â€

â€œVery well.â€ The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the
ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to
Mademoiselle Danglarsâ€™ contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to
Madame Danglars on the prudence a bankerâ€™s wife should exercise in
providing for the future.

M. Cavalcanti remained master of the field.



 Chapter 77. HaydÃ©e

Scarcely had the countâ€™s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard,
when Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of
laughterâ€”much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather
forced and unnatural.

â€œWell,â€ said he, â€œI will ask you the same question which Charles IX.
put to Catherine deâ€™ Medici, after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew:
â€˜How have I played my little part?â€™â€

â€œTo what do you allude?â€ asked Monte Cristo.

â€œTo the installation of my rival at M. Danglarsâ€™.â€

â€œWhat rival?â€

â€œ_Ma foi!_ what rival? Why, your protÃ©gÃ©, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!â€

â€œAh, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M.
Andreaâ€”at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.â€

â€œAnd you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man
really needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can
dispense with it.â€

â€œWhat, do you think he is paying his addresses?â€

â€œI am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when
addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He
aspires to the hand of the proud EugÃ©nie.â€

â€œWhat does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?â€

â€œBut it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed
on all sides.â€

â€œWhat!â€

â€œIt is so indeed; Mademoiselle EugÃ©nie scarcely answers me, and
Mademoiselle dâ€™Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.â€

â€œBut the father has the greatest regard possible for you,â€ said Monte
Cristo.

â€œHe? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart,
tragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points
in their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be
real and deadly.â€

â€œJealousy indicates affection.â€

â€œTrue; but I am not jealous.â€

â€œHe is.â€

â€œOf whom?â€”of Debray?â€

â€œNo, of you.â€

â€œOf me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will
be closed against me.â€

â€œYou are mistaken, my dear viscount.â€

â€œProve it to me.â€

â€œDo you wish me to do so?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWell, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the
Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.â€

â€œBy whom are you charged?â€

â€œBy the baron himself.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable. â€œYou
surely will not do that, my dear count?â€

â€œCertainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Albert, with a sigh, â€œit seems you are determined to marry
me.â€

â€œI am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all
events,â€ said Monte Cristo. â€œBut apropos of Debray, how is it that I
have not seen him lately at the baronâ€™s house?â€

â€œThere has been a misunderstanding.â€

â€œWhat, with the baroness?â€

â€œNo, with the baron.â€

â€œHas he perceived anything?â€

â€œAh, that is a good joke!â€

â€œDo you think he suspects?â€ said Monte Cristo with charming
artlessness.

â€œWhere have you come from, my dear count?â€ said Albert.

â€œFrom Congo, if you will.â€

â€œIt must be farther off than even that.â€

â€œBut what do I know of your Parisian husbands?â€

â€œOh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an
individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the
whole race.â€

â€œBut then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and
Debray? They seemed to understand each other so well,â€ said Monte
Cristo with renewed energy.

â€œAh, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in
which I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of
the family, you can ask him that question.â€

The carriage stopped.

â€œHere we are,â€ said Monte Cristo; â€œit is only half-past ten oâ€™clock,
come in.â€

â€œCertainly, I will.â€

â€œMy carriage shall take you back.â€

â€œNo, thank you; I gave orders for my _coupÃ©_ to follow me.â€

â€œThere it is, then,â€ said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the
carriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted
upâ€”they went in there. â€œYou will make tea for us, Baptistin,â€ said the
count. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in two
seconds reappeared, bringing on a tray, all that his master had
ordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground,
like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales.

â€œReally, my dear count,â€ said Morcerf, â€œwhat I admire in you is, not so
much your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than
yourself, nor is it only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have
possessed as much,â€”but it is your manner of being served, without any
questions, in a moment, in a second; it is as if they guessed what you
wanted by your manner of ringing, and made a point of keeping
everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness.â€

â€œWhat you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance, you
shall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, I should like to smoke.â€

Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a
second a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques
filled with excellent latakia.

â€œIt is quite wonderful,â€ said Albert.

â€œOh no, it is as simple as possible,â€ replied Monte Cristo. â€œAli knows
I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that
I ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when
I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as
he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested
through the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall
smoke in company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of
oneâ€”and now the mystery is solved.â€

â€œCertainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but it
is not the less true that youâ€”â€”Ah, but what do I hear?â€ and Morcerf
inclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to
issue resembling those of a guitar.

â€œ_Ma foi_, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening;
you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglarsâ€™ piano, to be attacked
by HaydÃ©eâ€™s guzla.â€

â€œHaydÃ©eâ€”what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women who bear
the name of HaydÃ©e anywhere but in Byronâ€™s poems?â€

â€œCertainly there are. HaydÃ©e is a very uncommon name in France, but is
common enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example,
Chastity, Modesty, Innocence,â€”it is a kind of baptismal name, as you
Parisians call it.â€

â€œOh, that is charming,â€ said Albert, â€œhow I should like to hear my
countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence,
Mademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle
Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-EugÃ©nie, had been named
Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect
that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!â€

â€œHush,â€ said the count, â€œdo not joke in so loud a tone; HaydÃ©e may hear
you, perhaps.â€

â€œAnd you think she would be angry?â€

â€œNo, certainly not,â€ said the count with a haughty expression.

â€œShe is very amiable, then, is she not?â€ said Albert.

â€œIt is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not
dictate to a master.â€

â€œCome; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be had
who bear this beautiful name?â€

â€œUndoubtedly.â€

â€œReally, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people. The
slave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in
France, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that
must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.â€

â€œA hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much
more than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which
those recorded in the _Thousand and One Nights_ would seem but
poverty.â€

â€œShe must be a princess then.â€

â€œYou are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.â€

â€œI thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess became
a slave?â€

â€œHow was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The
fortune of war, my dear viscount,â€”the caprice of fortune; that is the
way in which these things are to be accounted for.â€

â€œAnd is her name a secret?â€

â€œAs regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear
viscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence
I feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin itâ€”may I not do
so?â€

â€œCertainly; on my word of honor.â€

â€œYou know the history of the Pasha of Yanina, do you not?â€

â€œOf Ali Tepelini?13 Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made
his fortune.â€

â€œTrue, I had forgotten that.â€

40062m



â€œWell, what is HaydÃ©e to Ali Tepelini?â€

â€œMerely his daughter.â€

â€œWhat? the daughter of Ali Pasha?â€

â€œOf Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.â€

â€œAnd your slave?â€

â€œ_Ma foi_, yes.â€

â€œBut how did she become so?â€

â€œWhy, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as
I was passing through the market at Constantinople.â€

â€œWonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic
influence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you,
existence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am
perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, butâ€”â€”â€

â€œSay on.â€

â€œBut, since you go out with HaydÃ©e, and sometimes even take her to the
Operaâ€”â€”â€

â€œWell?â€

â€œI think I may venture to ask you this favor.â€

â€œYou may venture to ask me anything.â€

â€œWell then, my dear count, present me to your princess.â€

â€œI will do so; but on two conditions.â€

â€œI accept them at once.â€

â€œThe first is, that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the
interview.â€

â€œVery well,â€ said Albert, extending his hand; â€œI swear I will not.â€

â€œThe second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served
hers.â€

â€œI give you my oath that I will not.â€

â€œEnough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? But
I know you to be a man of honor.â€

The count again struck the gong. Ali reappeared. â€œTell HaydÃ©e,â€ said
he, â€œthat I will take coffee with her, and give her to understand that
I desire permission to present one of my friends to her.â€

Ali bowed and left the room.

â€œNow, understand me,â€ said the count, â€œno direct questions, my dear
Morcerf; if you wish to know anything, tell me, and I will ask her.â€

â€œAgreed.â€

Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the tapestried hanging
which concealed the door, to signify to his master and Albert that they
were at liberty to pass on.

â€œLet us go in,â€ said Monte Cristo.

Albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his moustache,
then, having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed
the count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat
and gloves. Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door
was kept by the three French attendants, commanded by Myrtho.

HaydÃ©e was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments,
which was the drawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise
and expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except Monte
Cristo, had been accorded an entrance into her presence. She was
sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed
under her in the Eastern fashion, and seemed to have made for herself,
as it were, a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped
her. Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing; it
was elegantly fashioned, and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving
Monte Cristo, she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to
herself, expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of
the deepest love. Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his
hand, which she as usual raised to her lips.

Albert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted
to the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such
surpassing beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an
inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea.

â€œWhom do you bring?â€ asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo;
â€œis it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.â€

â€œA friend,â€ said Monte Cristo in the same language.

â€œWhat is his name?â€

â€œCount Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the
banditti at Rome.â€

â€œIn what language would you like me to converse with him?â€

Monte Cristo turned to Albert. â€œDo you know modern Greek,â€ asked he.

â€œAlas! no,â€ said Albert; â€œnor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never
had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.â€

â€œThen,â€ said HaydÃ©e, proving by her remark that she had quite
understood Monte Cristoâ€™s question and Albertâ€™s answer, â€œthen I will
speak either in French or Italian, if my lord so wills it.â€

Monte Cristo reflected one instant. â€œYou will speak in Italian,â€ said
he.

Then, turning towards Albert,â€”â€œIt is a pity you do not understand
either ancient or modern Greek, both of which HaydÃ©e speaks so
fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian,
which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of
conversation.â€

The count made a sign to HaydÃ©e to address his visitor. â€œSir,â€ she said
to Morcerf, â€œyou are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.â€
This was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft Roman accent
which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer. Then,
turning to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he
had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she
beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf
drew their seats towards a small table, on which were arranged music,
drawings, and vases of flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and
chibouques; as to M. Baptistin, this portion of the building was
interdicted to him. Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered
him.

â€œOh, take itâ€”take it,â€ said the count; â€œHaydÃ©e is almost as civilized
as a Parisian; the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her, but the
tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume, you know.â€

Ali left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the
addition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and
HaydÃ©e took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to
say, without sugar. HaydÃ©e took the porcelain cup in her little slender
fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness
of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. At this
moment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and
sherbet, which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that
purpose.

â€œMy dear host, and you, signora,â€ said Albert, in Italian, â€œexcuse my
apparent stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it
should be so. Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard
the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the
lemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to
the East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have
painted it. Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation,
added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening
of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.â€

â€œI speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,â€
said HaydÃ©e quietly; â€œand if you like what is Eastern, I will do my
best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.â€

â€œOn what subject shall I converse with her?â€ said Albert, in a low tone
to Monte Cristo.

â€œJust what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful
reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples,
or Florence.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Albert, â€œit is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if
one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak
to her of the East.â€

â€œDo so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the
most agreeable to her taste.â€

Albert turned towards HaydÃ©e. â€œAt what age did you leave Greece,
signora?â€ asked he.

â€œI left it when I was but five years old,â€ replied HaydÃ©e.

â€œAnd have you any recollection of your country?â€

â€œWhen I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind
can see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes; but the mind
always remembers.â€

â€œAnd how far back into the past do your recollections extend?â€

â€œI could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which
means royal,â€ said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, â€œtook me
by the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed,
we went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the
prisoners, saying, â€˜He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.â€™
Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without
saying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was
divided amongst the prisoners.â€

â€œAnd how old were you at that time?â€

â€œI was three years old,â€ said HaydÃ©e.

â€œThen you remember everything that went on about you from the time when
you were three years old?â€ said Albert.

â€œEverything.â€

â€œCount,â€ said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, â€œdo allow the
signora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my
mentioning my fatherâ€™s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him
of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea
how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful
lips.â€

Monte Cristo turned to HaydÃ©e, and with an expression of countenance
which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he
said in Greek, â€œÎ Î±Ï„Ïá½¸Ï‚ Î¼á½²Î½ á¼„Ï„Î·Î½ Î¼á½µÎ¶Îµ Ï„á½¸ á½„Î½Î¿Î¼Î± Ï€ÏÎ¿Î´á½¹Ï„Î¿Ï… ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ï€ÏÎ¿Î´Î¿Ïƒá½·Î±Î½
Îµá¼°Ï€á½² á¼¡Î¼á¿–Î½,â€â€”that is, â€œTell us the fate of your father; but neither the
name of the traitor nor the treason.â€ HaydÃ©e sighed deeply, and a shade
of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.

â€œWhat are you saying to her?â€ said Morcerf in an undertone.

â€œI again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not
conceal anything from you.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Albert, â€œthis pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners
was your first remembrance; what is the next?â€

â€œOh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the
shade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters
of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the
oldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my
father; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by
playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or
with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from
time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which
I paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of
voice, either â€˜Kill,â€™ or â€˜Pardon.â€™â€

â€œIt is very strange,â€ said Albert, â€œto hear such words proceed from the
mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly
to be saying to oneâ€™s self, â€˜This is no fiction, it is all reality,â€™ in
order to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes,
accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?â€

â€œI think it is a fine country,â€ said HaydÃ©e, â€œbut I see France as it
really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my
own country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on
my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which
is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or
joyous.â€

â€œSo young,â€ said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Countâ€™s command
that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, â€œis it possible
that you can have known what suffering is except by name?â€

HaydÃ©e turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same
time some imperceptible sign, murmured:

â€œÎ•á¼°Ï€á½³â€”speak.â€

â€œNothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our
early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just
described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with
deepest sadness.â€

40068m



â€œSpeak, speak, signora,â€ said Albert, â€œI am listening with the most
intense delight and interest to all you say.â€

HaydÃ©e answered his remark with a melancholy smile. â€œYou wish me, then,
to relate the history of my past sorrows?â€ said she.

â€œI beg you to do so,â€ replied Albert.

â€œWell, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened
by my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from the
cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers
filled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her
weeping I began to cry too. â€˜Hush, child!â€™ said she. At other times in
spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a childâ€™s caprice
been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as
much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation
of such extreme terror in my motherâ€™s voice when she enjoined me to
silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given. She
bore me rapidly away.

â€œI saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were
all my motherâ€™s servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments, jewels,
purses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest
distraction.

â€œBehind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and
pistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since
they have again become a nation. You may imagine there was something
startling and ominous,â€ said HaydÃ©e, shaking her head and turning pale
at the mere remembrance of the scene, â€œin this long file of slaves and
women only half-aroused from sleep, or at least so they appeared to me,
who was myself scarcely awake. Here and there on the walls of the
staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the
flickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the
vaulted roof above.

â€œâ€˜Quick!â€™ said a voice at the end of the gallery. This voice made
everyone bow before it, resembling in its effect the wind passing over
a field of wheat, by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield
obeisance. As for me, it made me tremble. This voice was that of my
father. He came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his
hand the carbine which your emperor presented him. He was leaning on
the shoulder of his favorite Selim, and he drove us all before him, as
a shepherd would his straggling flock. My father,â€ said HaydÃ©e, raising
her head, â€œwas that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of
Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.â€

Albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced
with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if
there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the
expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of HaydÃ©e at this
moment; she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she
recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man,
to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror.

â€œSoon,â€ said HaydÃ©e, â€œwe halted on our march, and found ourselves on
the borders of a lake. My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart, and
at the distance of a few paces I saw my father, who was glancing
anxiously around. Four marble steps led down to the waterâ€™s edge, and
below them was a boat floating on the tide.

40070m



â€œFrom where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large
blank mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. This kiosk
appeared to me to be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of
the darkness of the night, which prevented any object from being more
than partially discerned. We stepped into the boat. I remember well
that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I
leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with
the sashes of our Palikares.14 Besides the rowers, the boat contained
only the women, my father, mother, Selim, and myself. The Palikares had
remained on the shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they
were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner
intended making a rampart of the three others, in case of pursuit. Our
bark flew before the wind. â€˜Why does the boat go so fast?â€™ asked I of
my mother.

â€œâ€˜Silence, child! Hush, we are flying!â€™ I did not understand. Why
should my father fly?â€”he, the all-powerfulâ€”he, before whom others were
accustomed to flyâ€”he, who had taken for his device,

â€˜They hate me; then they fear me!â€™


â€œIt was, indeed, a flight which my father was trying to effect. I have
been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina, fatigued
with long serviceâ€”â€”â€

Here HaydÃ©e cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo, whose eyes had
been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her
narrative. The young girl then continued, speaking slowly, like a
person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the
history which he is relating.

â€œYou were saying, signora,â€ said Albert, who was paying the most
implicit attention to the recital, â€œthat the garrison of Yanina,
fatigued with long serviceâ€”â€”â€

â€œHad treated with the Seraskier15 Kourchid, who had been sent by the
sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that
Ali Tepeliniâ€”after having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom
he reposed great confidenceâ€”resolved to retire to the asylum which he
had long before prepared for himself, and which he called
_kataphygion_, or the refuge.â€

â€œAnd this officer,â€ asked Albert, â€œdo you remember his name, signora?â€

Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl, which was
quite unperceived by Albert.

â€œNo,â€ said she, â€œI do not remember it just at this moment; but if it
should occur to me presently, I will tell you.â€

Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fatherâ€™s name, when Monte
Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man
recollected his promise, and was silent.

â€œIt was towards this kiosk that we were rowing. A ground floor,
ornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and
another floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the
eye. But beneath the ground floor, stretching out into the island, was
a large subterranean cavern, to which my mother, myself, and the women
were conducted. In this place were together 60,000 pouches and 200
barrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the
barrels were filled with 30,000 pounds of gunpowder.

â€œNear the barrels stood Selim, my fatherâ€™s favorite, whom I mentioned
to you just now. He stood watch day and night with a lance provided
with a lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up
everythingâ€”kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himselfâ€”at the
first signal given by my father. I remember well that the slaves,
convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives,
passed whole days and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. As for
me, I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young
soldier, and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, I
am quite sure I shall recognize Selim. I cannot tell you how long we
remained in this state; at that period I did not even know what time
meant. Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother
to the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as
I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances
of the slaves and Selimâ€™s fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to
pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon,
examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake,
while my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his
shoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that
unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round
objects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are invested
with the greatest importance. The heights of Pindus towered above us;
the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the
lake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the
distance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in
reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles.

â€œOne morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the
night, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than
usual. â€˜Take courage, Vasiliki,â€™ said he; â€˜today arrives the firman of
the master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be complete, we
shall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must
fly this night.â€™â€”â€˜But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do
so?â€™ said my mother. â€˜Oh, make yourself easy on that head,â€™ said Ali,
smiling; â€˜Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They
would be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die
with me.â€™

â€œMy mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did
not come from my fatherâ€™s heart. She prepared the iced water which he
was in the habit of constantly drinking,â€”for since his sojourn at the
kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,â€”after which she
anointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque,
which he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the
wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted
away in the surrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden
movement that I was paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes
from the object which had first attracted his attention, he asked for
his telescope. My mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter
than the marble against which she leaned. I saw my fatherâ€™s hand
tremble. â€˜A boat!â€”two!â€”three!â€™ murmured my, father;â€”â€˜four!â€™ He then
arose, seizing his arms and priming his pistols. â€˜Vasiliki,â€™ said he to
my mother, trembling perceptibly, â€˜the instant approaches which will
decide everything. In the space of half an hour we shall know the
emperorâ€™s answer. Go into the cavern with HaydÃ©e.â€™â€”â€˜I will not quit
you,â€™ said Vasiliki; â€˜if you die, my lord, I will die with you.â€™â€”â€˜Go to
Selim!â€™ cried my father. â€˜Adieu, my lord,â€™ murmured my mother,
determining quietly to await the approach of death. â€˜Take away
Vasiliki!â€™ said my father to his Palikares.

â€œAs for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran toward
Ali Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down
and pressed my forehead with his lips. Oh, how distinctly I remember
that kiss!â€”it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were
still warm on my forehead. On descending, we saw through the
lattice-work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct
to our view. At first they appeared like black specks, and now they
looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves. During this time,
in the kiosk at my fatherâ€™s feet, were seated twenty Palikares,
concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager
eyes the arrival of the boats. They were armed with their long guns
inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver, and cartridges in great numbers
were lying scattered on the floor. My father looked at his watch, and
paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest
anguish. This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I
quitted my father after that last kiss.

â€œMy mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern.
Selim was still at his post, and smiled sadly on us as we entered. We
fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern, and sat down by
Selim. In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and,
young as I was, I quite understood that some imminent danger was
hanging over our heads.â€

Albert had often heardâ€”not from his father, for he never spoke on the
subject, but from strangersâ€”the description of the last moments of the
vizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but the
story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of
the young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy
expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him.

As to HaydÃ©e, these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered
her for a moment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand
like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and
her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally
contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the
lake of Yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the
sombre picture which she sketched. Monte Cristo looked at her with an
indescribable expression of interest and pity.

â€œGo on, my child,â€ said the count in the Romaic language.

40074m



HaydÃ©e looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristoâ€™s
voice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative.

â€œIt was about four oâ€™clock in the afternoon, and although the day was
brilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the
cavern. One single, solitary light was burning there, and it appeared
like a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selimâ€™s flaming lance.
My mother was a Christian, and she prayed. Selim repeated from time to
time the sacred words: â€˜God is great!â€™ However, my mother had still
some hope. As she was coming down, she thought she recognized the
French officer who had been sent to Constantinople, and in whom my
father placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of
the French emperor were naturally noble and generous. She advanced some
steps towards the staircase, and listened. â€˜They are approaching,â€™ said
she; â€˜perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!â€™

â€œâ€˜What do you fear, Vasiliki?â€™ said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle
and yet so proud. â€˜If they do not bring us peace, we will give them
war; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.â€™ And he
renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of
Dionysus of old Crete.16 But I, being only a little child, was
terrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both
ferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of
the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us.

â€œMy mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.
â€˜Mamma, mamma,â€™ said I, â€˜are we really to be killed?â€™ And at the sound
of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and
lamentations. â€˜My child,â€™ said Vasiliki, â€˜may God preserve you from
ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread!â€™ Then,
whispering to Selim, she asked what were her masterâ€™s orders. â€˜If he
send me his poniard, it will signify that the emperorâ€™s intentions are
not favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary,
he send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him,
and I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.â€™â€”â€˜My
friend,â€™ said my mother, â€˜when your masterâ€™s orders arrive, if it is
the poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible
death which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with
this same poniard, will you not?â€™â€”â€˜Yes, Vasiliki,â€™ replied Selim
tranquilly.

â€œSuddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were
cries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to
Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was
evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was
favorable.â€

â€œAnd do you not remember the Frenchmanâ€™s name?â€ said Morcerf, quite
ready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to
him to be silent.

â€œI do not recollect it,â€ said HaydÃ©e.

â€œThe noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer;
they were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready
his lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance
of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which
had found their way into this gloomy retreat. â€˜Who are you?â€™ cried
Selim. â€˜But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another
step.â€™â€”â€˜Long live the emperor!â€™ said the figure. â€˜He grants a full
pardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores
to him his fortune and his possessions.â€™ My mother uttered a cry of
joy, and clasped me to her bosom. â€˜Stop,â€™ said Selim, seeing that she
was about to go out; â€˜you see I have not yet received the
ring,â€™â€”â€˜True,â€™ said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same
time holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to
God in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.â€

And for the second time HaydÃ©e stopped, overcome by such violent
emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled
voice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her

Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it
to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of
command,â€”â€œCourage.â€

HaydÃ©e dried her eyes, and continued:

â€œBy this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the
messenger of the pasha,â€”it was a friend. Selim had also recognized him,
but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty, which was to obey.
â€˜In whose name do you come?â€™ said he to him. â€˜I come in the name of our
master, Ali Tepelini.â€™â€”â€˜If you come from Ali himself,â€™ said Selim, â€˜you
know what you were charged to remit to me?â€™â€”â€˜Yes,â€™ said the messenger,
â€˜and I bring you his ring.â€™ At these words he raised his hand above his
head, to show the token; but it was too far off, and there was not
light enough to enable Selim, where he was standing, to distinguish and
recognize the object presented to his view. â€˜I do not see what you have
in your hand,â€™ said Selim. â€˜Approach then,â€™ said the messenger, â€˜or I
will come nearer to you, if you prefer it.â€™â€”â€˜I will agree to neither
one nor the other,â€™ replied the young soldier; â€˜place the object which
I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there, and retire
while I examine it.â€™â€”â€˜Be it so,â€™ said the envoy; and he retired, after
having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to
him by Selim.

â€œOh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a ring
which was placed there. But was it my fatherâ€™s ring? that was the
question. Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked
towards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which
streamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token.

â€œâ€˜It is well,â€™ said he, kissing it; â€˜it is my masterâ€™s ring!â€™ And
throwing the match on the ground, he trampled on it and extinguished
it. The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands. At this
signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared, and
Selim fell, pierced by five blows. Each man had stabbed him separately,
and, intoxicated by their crime, though still pale with fear, they
sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire,
after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold. At
this moment my mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying noiselessly
along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves, she
arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of
frightful tumult and confusion. The lower rooms were entirely filled
with Kourchidâ€™s troops; that is to say, with our enemies. Just as my
mother was on the point of pushing open a small door, we heard the
voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone. My mother
applied her eye to the crack between the boards; I luckily found a
small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was
passing within. â€˜What do you want?â€™ said my father to some people who
were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold. â€˜What we want,â€™
replied one, â€˜is to communicate to you the will of his highness. Do you
see this firman?â€™â€”â€˜I do,â€™ said my father. â€˜Well, read it; he demands
your head.â€™

â€œMy father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than
even threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of
a pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men.
The Palikares, who were prostrated at my fatherâ€™s feet, now sprang up
and fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. At the same
instant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated
the boards all round us. Oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father
look at that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar
in his hand, and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and
how he terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! â€˜Selim,
Selim!â€™ cried he, â€˜guardian of the fire, do your duty!â€™â€”â€˜Selim is
dead,â€™ replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the
earth, â€˜and you are lost, Ali!â€™ At the same moment an explosion was
heard, and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was
suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsâ€”the troops were firing from
underneath. Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally
ploughed with wounds.

â€œMy father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the
balls had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. But immediately
through this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame,
rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the
tapestry, which it quickly devoured. In the midst of all this frightful
tumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct,
followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with
terror. These two shots had mortally wounded my father, and it was he
who had given utterance to these frightful cries. However, he remained
standing, clinging to a window. My mother tried to force the door, that
she might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside. All
around him were lying the Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies,
while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape
by springing from the windows. At this crisis the whole flooring
suddenly gave way, my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment
twenty hands were thrust forth, armed with
