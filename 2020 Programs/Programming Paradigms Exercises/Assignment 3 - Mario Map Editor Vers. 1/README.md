This program is a Map Editor based on the videogame Super Mario.

If you click anywhere on the screen, a mario style tube will appear.

If a Tube is clicked, it gets removed.

Using the left & right arrow keys, it simulates a sidescrolling effect that moves all images accordingly.

Pressing the 's' key saves the current map as a Map.JSON file.

Pressing the 'l' key loads the most recent Map.JSON file.
