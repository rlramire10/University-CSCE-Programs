A father had two sons The oldest one was clever and intelligent and knew how to manage everything but the youngest one was stupid and could neither understand nor learn anything When people saw him they said He will be a burden on his father
Now when something had to be done it was always the oldest son who had to do it However if the father asked him fetch anything when it was late or even worse at night and if the way led through the churchyard or some other spooky place he would always answer Oh no father I wont go there It makes me shudder For he was afraid
In the evening by the fire when stories were told that made ones flesh creep the listeners sometimes said Oh that makes me shudder The youngest son would sit in a corner and listen with the others but he could not imagine what they meant
They are always saying It makes me shudder It makes me shudder It does not make me shudder That too must be a skill that I do not understand
Now it happened that one day his father said to him Listen you there in the corner You are getting big and strong You too will have to learn something by which you can earn your bread See how your brother puts himself out but there seems to be no hope for you
Well father he answered I do want to learn something Indeed if possible I would like to learn how to shudder I dont understand that at all yet
The oldest son laughed when he heard that and thought to himself Dear God what a dimwit that brother of mine is Nothing will come of him as long as he lives As the twig is bent so grows the tree
The father sighed and answered him You may well learn to shudder but you will not earn your bread by shuddering
Soon afterward the sexton came to the house on a visit and the father complained to him about his troubles telling him how his younger son was so stupid in everything that he knew nothing and was learning nothing Just think he said when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread he actually asked to learn to shudder
If there is nothing more than that replied the sexton he can learn that with me Just send him to me I will plane off his rough edges
The father agreed to do this for he thought It will do the boy well
So the sexton took him home with him and he was to ring the church bell A few days later the sexton awoke him at midnight and told him to get up climb the church tower and ring the bell
You will soon learn what it is to shudder he thought He secretly went there ahead of him After the boy had reached the top of the tower had turned around and was about to take hold of the bell rope he saw a white figure standing on the steps opposite the sound hole
Who is there he shouted but the figure gave no answer neither moving nor stirring Answer me shouted the boy or get out of here You have no business here at night
The sexton however remained standing there motionless so that the boy would think he was a ghost
The boy shouted a second time What do you want here Speak if you are an honest fellow or I will throw you down the stairs
The sexton thought He cant seriously mean that He made not a sound and stood as if he were made of stone
Then the boy shouted to him for the third time and as that also was to no avail he ran toward him and pushed the ghost down the stairs It fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner Then the boy rang the bell went home and without saying a word went to bed and fell asleep
The sextons wife waited a long time for her husband but he did not come back Finally she became frightened and woke up the boy asking Dont you know where my husband is He climbed up the tower before you did
No replied the boy but someone was standing by the sound hole on the other side of the steps and because he would neither give an answer nor go away I took him for a thief and threw him down the steps Go there and you will see if he was the one I am sorry if he was
The woman ran out and found her husband who was lying in the corner moaning He had broken his leg She carried him down and then crying loudly she hurried to the boys father Your boy she shouted has caused a great misfortune He threw my husband down the steps causing him to break his leg Take the goodfornothing out of our house
The father was alarmed and ran to the sextons house and scolded the boy What evil tricks are these The devil must have prompted you to do them
Father he replied do listen to me I am completely innocent He was standing there in the night like someone with evil intentions I did not know who it was and I warned him three times to speak or to go away
Oh said the father I have experienced nothing but unhappiness with you Get out of my sight I do not want to look at you anymore
Yes father and gladly Just wait until daylight and I will go forth and learn how to shudder Then I shall have a skill that will support me
Learn what you will said the father It is all the same to me Here are fifty talers for you Take them and go into the wide world but tell no one where you come from or who your father is because I am ashamed of you
Yes father I will do just as you wish If that is all you want from me I can easily remember it
So at daybreak the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket and went forth on the main road continually saying to himself If only I could shudder If only I could shudder
A man came up to him and heard this conversation that the boy was holding with himself and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows the man said to him Look there is the tree where seven men got married to the rope makers daughter and are now learning how to fly Sit down beneath it and wait until night comes and then you will learn how to shudder
If there is nothing more than that answered the boy I can do it easily But if I learn how to shudder that quickly you shall have my fifty talers Just come back to me tomorrow morning
Then the boy went to the gallows sat down beneath them and waited until evening Because he was cold he made himself a fire However at midnight there came up such a cold wind that in spite of his fire he could not get warm And as the wind pushed the hanged men against each other causing them to move to and fro he thought You are freezing down here next to the fire Those guys up there must really be freezing and suffering Feeling pity for them he put up the ladder and climbed up untied them one after the other and then brought down all seven
Then he stirred up the fire blew into it and set them all around it to warm themselves But they just sat there without moving and their clothes caught fire So he said Be careful or I will hang you up again
The dead men however heard nothing and said nothing and they let their rags continue to burn This made him angry and he said If you wont be careful I cant help you I dont want to burn up with you So he hung them up again all in a row Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep
The next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers He said Well do you know how to shudder
No he answered Where would I have learned it Those fellows up there did not open their mouths They were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies catch fire
Then the man saw that he would not be getting the fifty talers that day He went away saying Never before have I met such a fellow
The boy went on his way as well and once more began muttering to himself  Oh if only I could shudder Oh if only I could shudder
A cart driver who was walking along behind him heard this and asked Who are you
I dont know replied the boy
Then the cart driver asked Where do you come from
I dont know
Who is your father
I am not permitted to say
What are you always muttering to yourself
Oh replied the boy I want to be able shudder but no one can teach me how
Stop that foolish chatter said the cart driver Come walk along with me and I will see that I get a place for you
The boy went with the cart driver and that evening they came to an inn where they decided to spend the night On entering the main room the boy again said quite loudly If only I could shudder If only I could shudder
Hearing this the innkeeper laughed and said If that is your desire there should be a good opportunity for you here
Oh be quiet said the innkeepers wife Too many meddlesome people have already lost their lives It would be a pity and a shame if his beautiful eyes would never again see the light of day
But the boy said I want to learn to shudder however difficult it may be That is why I left home
He gave the innkeeper no rest until the latter told him that there was a haunted castle not far away where a person could very easily learn how to shudder if he would just keep watch there for three nights The king had promised that whoever would dare to do this could have his daughter in marriage and she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun Further in the castle there were great treasures guarded by evil spirits These treasures would then be freed and would make a poor man rich enough Many had entered the castle but no one had come out again
The next morning the boy went to the king and said If it be allowed I will keep watch three nights in the haunted castle
The king looked at him and because the boy pleased him he said You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you but they must be things that are not alive
To this the boy replied Then I ask for a fire a lathe and a woodcarvers bench with a knife
The king had all these things carried into the castle for him during the day When night was approaching the boy went inside and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms placed the woodcarvers bench and knife beside it and sat down at the lathe
Oh if only I could shudder he said But I wont learn it here either
Towards midnight he decided to stir up his fire He was just blowing into it when a cry suddenly came from one of the corners Au meow How cold we are
You fools he shouted what are you crying about If you are cold come and sit down by the fire and warm yourselves
When he had said that two large black cats came with a powerful leap and sat down on either side of him looking at him savagely with their fiery eyes
A little while later after warming themselves they said Comrade shall we play a game of cards
Why not he replied But first show me your paws
So they stretched out their claws
Oh he said what long nails you have Wait First I will have to trim them for you
With that he seized them by their necks put them on the woodcarvers bench and tightened them into the vice by their feet I have been looking at your fingers he said and my desire to play cards has disappeared and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water
After he had put these two to rest he was about to sit down again by his fire when from every side and every corner there came black cats and black dogs on redhot chains More and more of them appeared until he could no longer move They shouted horribly then jumped into his fire and pulled it apart trying to put it out
He quietly watched them for a little while but finally it was too much for him and he seized his carvingknife and cried Away with you you villains and hacked away at them Some of them ran away the others he killed and threw out into the pond When he came back he blew into the embers of his fire until they flamed up again and warmed himself
As he thus sat there his eyes would no longer stay open and he wanted to fall asleep Looking around he saw a large bed in the corner That is just what I wanted he said and lay down in it However as he was about to shut his eyes the bed began to move by itself going throughout the whole castle
Good he said but lets go faster
Then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it over thresholds and stairways up and down But then suddenly hop hop it tipped upside down and lay on him like a mountain But he threw the covers and pillows into the air climbed out and said Now anyone who wants to may drive Then he lay down by his fire and slept until it was day
In the morning the king came and when he saw him lying there on the ground he thought that the ghosts had killed him and that he was dead Then said he It is indeed a pity to lose such a handsome person
The boy heard this got up and said It hasnt come to that yet
The king was astonished but glad and asked how he had fared
Very well he replied One night is past The two others will pass as well
When he returned to the innkeeper the latter looked astonished and said I did not think that Id see you alive again Did you learn how to shudder
No he said it is all in vain If someone could only tell me how
The second night he again went up to the old castle sat down by the fire and began his old song once more If only I could shudder
As midnight was approaching he heard a noise and commotion At first it was soft but then louder and louder Then it was a little quiet and finally with a loud scream half of a man came down the chimney and fell in front of him
Hey he shouted Another half belongs here This is too little
Then the noise began again With roaring and howling the other half fell down as well
Wait he said Let me blow on the fire and make it burn a little warmer for you
When he had done that and looked around again The two pieces had come together and a hideous man was sitting in his place
That wasnt part of the wager said the boy That bench is mine
The man wanted to force him aside but the boy would not let him instead pushing him away with force and then sitting down again in his own place
Then still more men fell down one after the other They brought nine bones from dead men and two skulls then set them up and bowled with them
The boy wanted to play too and said Listen can I bowl with you
Yes if you have money
Money enough he answered but your bowling balls are not quite round Then he took the skulls put them in the lathe and turned them round
There now they will roll better he said Hey This will be fun
He played with them and lost some of his money but when the clock struck twelve everything disappeared before his eyes He lay down and peacefully fell asleep
The next morning the king came to learn what had happened How did you do this time he asked
I went bowling he answered and lost a few pennies
Did you shudder
How he said I had great fun but if I only knew how to shudder
On the third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly If only I could shudder
When it was late six large men came in carrying a coffin At this he said Aha for certain that is my little cousin who died a few days ago Then he motioned with his finger and cried out Come little cousin come
They put the coffin on the ground He went up to it and took the lid off A dead man lay inside He felt his face and it was cold as ice
Wait he said I will warm you up a little He went to the fire and warmed his own hand then laid it on the dead mans face but the dead man remained cold Then he took him out sat down by the fire and laid him on his lap rubbing the dead mans arms to get the blood circulating again
When that did not help either he thought to himself When two people lie in bed together they keep each other warm So he carried the dead man to the bed put him under the covers and lay down next to him A little while later the dead man became warm too and began to move
The boy said See little cousin I got you warm didnt I
But the dead man cried out I am going to strangle you
What he said Is that my thanks Get back into your coffin Then he picked him up threw him inside and shut the lid Then the six men came and carried him away again
I cannot shudder he said I wont learn it here as long as I live
Then a man came in He was larger than all others and looked frightful But he was old and had a long white beard
You wretch he shouted you shall soon learn what it is to shudder for you are about to die
Not so fast answered the boy If I am to die I will have to be there
Ive got you said the monster
Now now dont boast I am just as strong as you are and probably even stronger
We shall see said the old man If you are stronger than I am I shall let you go Come lets put it to the test
Then the old man led him through dark passageways to a blacksmiths forge took an ax and with one blow drove one of the anvils into the ground
I can do better than that said the boy and went to the other anvil The old man stood nearby wanting to look on His white beard hung down The boy seized the ax and split the anvil with one blow wedging the old mans beard in the crack
Now I have you said the boy Now it is your turn to die Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man until he moaned and begged him to stop promising that he would give him great riches The boy pulled out the ax and released him The old man led him back into the castle and showed him three chests full of gold in a cellar
Of these he said one is for the poor the second one is for the king and the third one is yours
Meanwhile it struck twelve and the spirit disappeared leaving the boy standing in the dark I can find my own way out he said Feeling around he found his way to the bedroom and fell asleep by his fire
The next morning the king came and said By now you must have learned how to shudder
No he answered What is it My dead cousin was here and a bearded man came and showed me a large amount of money down below but no one showed me how to shudder
Then the king said You have redeemed the castle and shall marry my daughter
That is all very well said the boy but I still do not know how to shudder
Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated but however much the young king loved his wife and however happy he was he still was always saying If only I could shudder If only I could shudder With time this made her angry
Her chambermaid said I can help I know how he can learn to shudder
She went out to the brook that flowed through the garden and caught a whole bucketful of minnows That night when the young king was asleep his wife was to pull the covers off him and pour the bucketful of cold water and minnows onto him so that the little fishes would wriggle all over him
When she did this he woke up crying out Oh what is making me shudder What is making me shudder dear wife Yes now I know how to shudder
Once upon a time there was an old goat She had seven little kids and loved them all just as a mother loves her children One day she wanted to go into the woods to get some food So she called all seven to her and said Children dear I am going into the woods Be on your guard for the wolf If he gets in he will eat up all of you all even your skin and hair The villain often disguises himself but you will recognize him at once by his rough voice and his black feet
The kids said Mother dear we will take care of ourselves You can go away without any worries
Then the old one bleated and went on her way with her mind at ease
It was not long before someone knocked at the door and called out Open the door children dear your mother is here and has brought something for each one of you
But the little kids knew from the rough voice that it was the wolf
We will not open the door they cried out You are not our mother She has a soft and gentle voice but your voice is rough You are the wolf
So the wolf went to a shopkeeper and bought himself a large piece of chalk which he ate making his voice soft Then he came back and knocked at the door calling out Open the door children dear Your mother is here and has brought something for each one of you
But the wolf laid one of his black paws inside the window The children saw it and cried out We will not open the door Our mother does not have a black foot like you You are the wolf
So the wolf ran to a baker and said I have sprained my foot Rub some dough on it for me After the baker had rubbed dough on his foot the wolf ran to the miller and said Sprinkle some white flour on my foot for me
The miller thought The wolf wants to deceive someone and refused to do it so the wolf said If you will not do it I will eat you up That frightened the miller and he made his paw white for him Yes that is the way people are
Now the villain went for a third time to the door knocked at it and said Open the door for me children Your dear little mother has come home and has brought every one of you something from the woods
The little kids cried out First show us your paw so we may know that you are our dear little mother
So he put his paw inside the window and when they saw that it was white they believed that everything he said was true and they opened the door But who came in It was the wolf They were terrified and wanted to hide One jumped under the table the second into the bed the third into the stove the fourth into the kitchen the fifth into the cupboard the sixth under the washbasin and the seventh into the clock case But the wolf found them all and with no further ado he swallowed them down his throat one after the other However he did not find the youngest kid the one who was in the clock case
After satisfying his appetite he went outside and lay down under a tree in the green meadow and fell asleep
Soon afterward the old goat came home from the woods Oh what a sight she saw there The door stood wide open Table chairs and benches were tipped over The washbasin was in pieces The covers and pillows had been pulled off the bed She looked for her children but they were nowhere to be found She called them by name one after the other but no one answered When she at last came to the youngest a soft voice cried out Mother dear I am hiding in the clock case She took it out and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten up all the others You can just imagine how she cried for her poor children
Finally in her despair she went outside and the youngest kid ran with her They came to the meadow and there lay the wolf by the tree snoring so loudly that the branches shook She looked at him from all sides and saw that something was moving and jiggling inside his full belly
Good gracious she thought Is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper can still be alive
The mother goat sent the kid home and to fetch scissors and a needle and thread and then she cut open the monsters paunch She had scarcely made one cut before a little kid stuck its head out and as she continued to cut one after the other all six jumped out and they were all still alive They were not even hurt for in his greed the monster had swallowed them down whole How happy they were They hugged their dear mother and jumped about like a tailor on his wedding day
But the mother said Go now and look for some big stones We will fill the godless beasts stomach with them while he is still asleep
The seven kids quickly brought the stones and they put as many as many of them into his stomach as it would hold Then the mother hurriedly sewed him up again He was not aware of anything and never once stirred
The wolf finally awoke and got up onto his legs Because the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty he wanted to go to a well and get a drink But when he began to walk and to move about the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled
Then he cried out
What rumbles and tumbles
Inside of me
I thought it was kids
But its stones that they be
When he got to the well and leaned over the water to drink the heavy stones pulled him in and he drowned miserably
When the seven kids saw what had happened they ran up and cried out The wolf is dead The wolf is dead And with their mother they danced for joy around about the well
