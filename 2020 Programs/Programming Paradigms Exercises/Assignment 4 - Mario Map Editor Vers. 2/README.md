This program is a Map Editor based on the videogame Super Mario.


Program Properties:

If you click anywhere on the screen, a mario style tube will appear.

If a Tube is clicked, it gets removed.

Pressing the 's' key saves the current map as a Map.JSON file.

Pressing the 'l' key loads the most recent Map.JSON file.

A single horizontal line is dsplayed to simulate a floor Mario can walk on.

A Mario sprite is now generated on screen.

Using the left & right arrow keys moves Mario accordingly. The Mario movement animation is created using multiple png files looping whenever movement is detected.

Spacebar makes mario jump. Mario can jump higher by holding spacebar. Mario can jump only once, he can jump again once he lands on a surface.

Sprite Collision Detection is in place so that Mario does not phase through Tubes from any direction. This allows him to stand on Tubes as well.
