In olden times when wishing still did some good there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself who indeed has seen so much marveled every time it shone upon her face In the vicinity of the kings castle there was a large dark forest and in this forest beneath an old linden tree there was a well In the heat of the day the princess would go out into the forest and sit on the edge of the cool well To pass the time she would take a golden ball throw it into the air and then catch it It was her favorite plaything
Now one day it happened that the princesss golden ball did not fall into her hands that she held up high but instead it fell to the ground and rolled right into the water The princess followed it with her eyes but the ball disappeared and the well was so deep that she could not see its bottom Then she began to cry She cried louder and louder and she could not console herself
As she was thus lamenting someone called out to her What is the matter with you princess Your crying would turn a stone to pity
She looked around to see where the voice was coming from and saw a frog who had stuck his thick ugly head out of the water Oh its you old watersplasher she said I am crying because my golden ball has fallen into the well
Be still and stop crying answered the frog I can help you but what will you give me if I bring back your plaything
Whatever you want dear frog she said my clothes my pearls and precious stones and even the golden crown that I am wearing
The frog answered I do not want your clothes your pearls and precious stones nor your golden crown but if you will love me and accept me as a companion and playmate and let me sit next to you at your table and eat from your golden plate and drink from your cup and sleep in your bed if you will promise this to me then Ill dive down and bring your golden ball back to you
Oh yes she said I promise all of that to you if you will just bring the ball back to me But she thought What is this stupid frog trying to say He just sits here in the water with his own kind and croaks He cannot be a companion to a human
As soon as the frog heard her say yes he stuck his head under and dove to the bottom He paddled back up a short time later with the golden ball in his mouth and threw it onto the grass The princess was filled with joy when she saw her beautiful plaything once again picked it up and ran off
Wait wait called the frog take me along I cannot run as fast as you But what did it help him that he croaked out after her as loudly as he could She paid no attention to him but instead hurried home and soon forgot the poor frog who had to return again to his well
The next day the princess was sitting at the table with the king and all the people of the court and was eating from her golden plate when something came creeping up the marble steps plip plop plip plop As soon as it reached the top there came a knock at the door and a voice called out Princess youngest open the door for me
She ran to see who was outside She opened the door and the frog was sitting there Frightened she slammed the door shut and returned to the table The king saw that her heart was pounding and asked My child why are you afraid Is there a giant outside the door who wants to get you
Oh no she answered it is a disgusting frog
What does the frog want from you
Oh father dear yesterday when I was sitting near the well in the forest and playing my golden ball fell into the water And because I was crying so much the frog brought it back and because he insisted I promised him that he could be my companion but I didnt think that he could leave his water But now he is just outside the door and wants to come in
Just then there came a second knock at the door and a voice called out
Youngest daughter of the king
Open up the door for me
Dont you know what yesterday
You said to me down by the well
Youngest daughter of the king
Open up the door for me
The king said What you have promised you must keep Go and let the frog in
She went and opened the door and the frog hopped in then followed her up to her chair He sat there and called out Lift me up next to you
She hesitated until finally the king commanded her to do it When the frog was seated next to her he said Now push your golden plate closer so we can eat together
She did it but one could see that she did not want to The frog enjoyed his meal but for her every bite stuck in her throat Finally he said I have eaten all I want and am tired Now carry me to your room and make your bed so that we can go to sleep
The princess began to cry and was afraid of the cold frog and did not dare to even touch him and yet he was supposed to sleep in her beautiful clean bed
The king became angry and said You should not despise someone who has helped you in time of need
She picked him up with two fingers carried him upstairs and set him in a corner As she was lying in bed he came creeping up to her and said I am tired and I want to sleep as well as you do Pick me up or Ill tell your father
With that she became bitterly angry and threw him against the wall with all her might Now you will have your peace you disgusting frog
But when he fell down he was not a frog but a prince with beautiful friendly eyes And he was now according to her fathers will her dear companion and husband He told her how he had been enchanted by a wicked witch and that she alone could have rescued him from the well and that tomorrow they would go together to his kingdom Then they fell asleep
The next morning just as the sun was waking them a carriage pulled up drawn by eight horses They had white ostrich feathers on their heads and were outfitted with chains of gold At the rear stood the young kings servant faithful Heinrich Faithful Heinrich had been so saddened by his masters transformation into a frog that he had had to place three iron bands around his heart to keep it from bursting in grief and sorrow The carriage was to take the king back to his kingdom Faithful Heinrich lifted them both inside and took his place at the rear He was filled with joy over the redemption After they had gone a short distance the prince heard a crack from behind as though something had broken
He turned around and said Heinrich the carriage is breaking apart
No my lord the carriage its not
But one of the bands surrounding my heart
That suffered such great pain
When you were sitting in the well
When you were a frog
Once again and then once again the prince heard a cracking sound and thought that the carriage was breaking apart but it was the bands springing from faithful Heinrichs heart because his master was now redeemed and happy
A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together But we must make preparations for winter or else we shall suffer from hunger said the cat and you little mouse cannot venture out everywhere or in the end you will be caught in a trap
This good advice was followed and they bought a pot of fat but they did not know where to store it Finally after much consideration the cat said I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church No one dares take anything away from there We will put it beneath the altar and not touch it until we are need it
So the pot was stored safely away but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it and said to the mouse I wanted to tell you little mouse that my cousin has brought a little son into the world and she has asked me to be his godfather He is white with brown spots and I am to hold him over the baptismal font Let me go out today and you look after the house by yourself
Yes yes answered the mouse By all means go and if you get anything good to eat think of me I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself
All this however was untrue The cat had no cousin and had not been asked to be godfather He went straight to the church crept up to the pot of fat began to lick at it and licked off the top of the fat Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town looked out for opportunities and then stretched out in the sun licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat He did not return home until it was evening
Well here you are again said the mouse You must have had a happy day
Everything went well answered the cat
What name did they give the child asked the mouse
TopOff said the cat quite coolly
TopOff cried the mouse That is a very odd and uncommon name Is it a usual one in your family
What does that matter said the cat It is no worse than CrumbThief as your godchildren are called
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing He said to the mouse You must do me a favor and once more manage the house alone for a day I have been asked again to be godfather and since the child has a white ring around its neck I cannot refuse
The good mouse consented However the cat crept behind the town wall to the church and devoured half the pot of fat Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself he said and was quite satisfied with his days work
When he arrived home the mouse asked What name was this child christened with
HalfGone answered the cat
HalfGone What are you saying I have never heard that name in all my life Ill wager it is not in the almanac
The cats mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods All good things come in threes he said to the mouse I have been asked to be godfather again The child is totally black only it has white paws Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body This only happens once every few years You will let me go wont you
TopOff HalfGone answered the mouse They are such odd names that they make me stop and think
Here you sit at home said the cat with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies That is because you do not go out in the daytime
During the cats absence the mouse cleaned the house and put it in order but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat One has peace only after everything is eaten up he said to himself Well filled and fat he did not return home until nighttime
The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child
You will not like it either said the cat His name is AllGone
AllGone cried the mouse That is the most worrisome name of all I have never seen it in print AllGone What can that mean Then she shook her head curled herself up and lay down to sleep
From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside the mouse thought of their stored food and said Come cat we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves It will taste good now
Yes answered the cat You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window
They set out on their way but when they arrived the pot of fat to be sure was still in its place but it was empty Alas said the mouse now I see what has happened Now it comes to light You are a true friend You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather First top off then half done then 
Be quiet cried the cat One more word and I will eat you too
All gone was already on the poor mouses lips She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her seized her and swallowed her down You see that is the way of the world
Near a great forest there lived a woodcutter with his wife He had but one child a threeyear old girl Now they were so poor that they no longer had their daily bread and they did not know how they were to feed her
One morning the woodcutter filled with sorrow went out to his work in the woods While he was chopping wood suddenly there stood before him a beautiful tall woman with a crown of shining stars on her head
She said to him I am the Virgin Mary mother of the Baby Jesus You are poor and needy Bring your child to me I will take her with me and be her mother and care for her
The woodcutter obeyed fetched his child and turned her over to the Virgin Mary who took her up into heaven with her There the child fared well She ate sweetened bread and drank fresh milk Her clothes were of gold and the little angels played with her
When she was fourteen years old the Virgin Mary summoned her one day and said Dear child I am about to make a long journey Take care of these keys to the thirteen doors of heaven You may open twelve of these doors and behold the glorious things inside but the thirteenth door to which this little key belongs is forbidden for you Be careful not to open it or you will be unhappy
The girl promised to be obedient and when the Virgin Mary was gone she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven Each day she opened one of them until she had been to all twelve An apostle surrounded by great brilliance sat in each one She rejoiced in the magnificence and splendor and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her
Now only the forbidden door remained and she felt a great desire to know what was hidden behind it She said to the little angels I will not open it all the way nor will I will go inside but I will only unlock it so that we can see just a little through the crack
Oh no said the little angels that would be a sin The Virgin Mary has forbidden it and it might easily lead to unhappiness for you
To that she said nothing but the desire in her heart was not stilled To the contrary it gnawed away tormenting her and would give her no rest
Then one day when the angels had all gone out she thought  I am entirely alone now and I could peek in If I do so no one will ever know
She sought out the key and as soon as she had it in her hand she put it into the lock as well and as soon as it was in the lock she turned it around as well The door sprang open and there she saw the Trinity sitting in fire and brilliance She stayed there a little while looking at everything in amazement Then she put her finger a little way into the brilliance and her finger turned entirely golden Immediately a great fear fell upon her She slammed the door shut and ran away
The fear did not go away do what she may He heart pounded furiously forth and would not become still And the gold remained on her finger as well It would not come off no matter how much she washed and rubbed
Not long afterward the Virgin Mary returned from her journey She summoned the girl and asked her to return the keys of heaven When the girl gave the ring of keys to her the Virgin looked into her eyes and said Have you not opened the thirteenth door as well
No she replied
Then the Virgin Mary laid her hand on the girls heart and felt how it pounded and pounded and saw well that she had disobeyed her order and had opened the door Then she said further You did not do it for sure
No said the girl a second time
Then the Virgin noticed the finger that had turned golden from having touched the heavenly fire and knew well that the girl had sinned and she said a third time Have you not done it
No said the girl a third time
Then the Virgin Mary said You have not obeyed me and you have lied as well You are no longer worthy to be in heaven
Then the girl sank into a deep sleep and when she awoke she lay below on earth in the middle of a wilderness She wanted to cry out but she could not bring forth a sound She jumped up and wanted to run away but in wherever she turned she was held back by thick thorn hedges which she could not break through In the wilderness where she was imprisoned there stood an old hollow tree It would have to serve as her home She crept inside it when night came and slept there And when it stormed and rained she found shelter inside it but it was a miserable life and she cried bitterly when she thought about how beautiful it had been in heaven and how the angels had played with her
Roots and wild berries were her only food which she looked for as far as she could go In the fall she gathered the fallen nuts and leaves and carried them into the opening in the tree The nuts were her food during the winter and when snow and ice came she crept under the leaves like a poor little animal so that she would not freeze Before long her clothes were ripped to shreds and one piece of them after another fell off her
When the sun shone warmly again she went outside and sat in front of the tree Her long hair covered her on all sides like a cloak Thus she sat year after year feeling the worlds misery and pain
One day when the trees were once again a fresh green the king of the country was hunting in the woods He followed a deer that had fled into the thicket that surrounded this part of the woods Getting off his horse he tore the brush aside and cut himself a path with his sword When he had at last forced his way through he saw a wonderfully beautiful girl sitting under the tree covered entirely with her golden hair down to her toes
Filled with amazement he stood still and looked at her then he spoke to her saying Who are you Why are you sitting here in this wilderness
But she gave no answer for she could not open her mouth
The king continued Will you go with me to my castle
To this she just nodded her head a little The king took her into his arms lifted her onto his horse and rode home with her Arriving at the royal castle he had her dressed in beautiful clothing and gave her an abundance of everything Although she could not speak she was still so beautiful and charming that he fell in love her with all his heart and it was not long before he married her
About a year later the new queen brought a son into the world Afterward the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she was lying alone in her bed and said If you will tell the truth and confess that you unlocked the forbidden door I will open your mouth and give you back your speech but if you persevere in sin and stubbornly deny it I will take your newborn child away with me
The queen was allowed to answer but she remained obstinate and said No I did not open the forbidden door and the Virgin Mary took the newborn child out of her arms and disappeared with it
The next morning when the child was not to be found it was rumored among the people that the queen was a cannibal and had killed her own child She heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary but the king did not want to believe it because he loved her so much
One year later the queen again bore a son In the night the Virgin Mary again came to her and said If you will confess that you opened the forbidden door I will give you your child back and release your tongue but if you continue in sin and deny it then I will take this newborn child with me as well
Then the queen said again No I did not open the forbidden door and the Virgin took the child out of her arms and took it away with her to heaven
The next morning when this child had disappeared as well the people loudly said that the queen had eaten it and the kings councilors demanded that she should be brought to justice The king however loved her so dearly that he would not believe it and ordered the councilors under threat of death to say nothing more about it
The following year the queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter and for a third time the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night
She said Follow me Taking the queen by the hand she led her to heaven and showed her there her two oldest children who were laughing and playing with the ball of the world
When the queen rejoiced at seeing this the Virgin Mary said Has your heart not yet softened If you will confess that you opened the forbidden door I will give you back your two little sons
But for a third time the queen answered No I did not open the forbidden door Then the virgin let her sink down to earth again and took away her third child as well
The next morning when it became known all the people shouted loudly The queen is a cannibal She must be condemned And the king was no longer able to hold back his councilors
A trial was held and as she was not able to respond and defend herself she was condemned to be burned at the stake Wood was piled together After she had been bound tightly to a stake and the fire was beginning to burn around her the hard ice of pride melted Her heart was moved by regret and she thought If only I could confess before my death that I opened the door
Then her voice came back to her and she cried out loudly Yes Mary I did it
Immediately rain began to fall from heaven and it put out the fiery flames A light broke forth above her and the Virgin Mary descended She had the two little sons by her side and the newborn daughter on her arm Speaking kindly to her she said Whoever repents a sin and confesses it will be forgiven
Then she gave her the three children released her tongue and gave her happiness for her entire life
