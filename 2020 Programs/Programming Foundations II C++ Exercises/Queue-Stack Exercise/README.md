The goal of this programming assignment is for students to gain experience with the implementation and use of stacks and queues. Instead of using a fixed size array, or	a variable length linked list, you will	be using the C++ vector class to create the “container” to store the stack’s and queue’s data. The vector class was	invented specifically to have the advantages of	an array (data elements can be accessed by index) and	of a linked list (growing or shrinking to	meet the needs of an application). This	means that you can enjoy the speed of	traditional algorithms for array based stacks and queues, and still avoid stack-overflow or queue-overflow situations.

This program deminstates the implementation of both queues and stacks.

The program will prompt the user to enter how many queue/stack operations will be used.

Once provided, the program will then execute those operations at random and display the effects.

The program would then display a breakdown of what was executed.
