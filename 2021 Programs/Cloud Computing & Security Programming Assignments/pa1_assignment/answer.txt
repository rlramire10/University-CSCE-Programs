1) The simplest approach is to place a counter within the map method that increments
   by one every  time it is called. However, normal variable based counters would not
   work due to the inability to reliably predict the size and type of input. Instead,
   the function "context.write(phrase, one);" would be used. That line of code would
   create one key value pair every time the map method is called. When everything is
   complete, the IntSumReducer class would combine all the map pairs together creating
   an accurate count of the map method being called.
