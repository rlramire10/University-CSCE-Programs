In order to figure out how many times the reduce method gets used, you need to create a
counter within the reduce method. When counting the map mrthod, we utilized wordpairs and
emitted one every time the map method was used. While that was a good apporach, we can not
do the same thing here since emitting a wordpair within the reducer will not allow it to
get combined and counted. Instead, we could create a counter variable and increment it by 1
everytime the reduce method runs. To print the result, the final value of the counter
would be implemented into a wordpair and then emitted within the cleanup() method. This 
would insure that only one count would be produced and only after the entire reduce task is
complete.
